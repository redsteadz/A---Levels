# Why Bond ?
- **Except for Group 8** Elements do not have a complete shell
	- Group **1** have **1e in final shell**
	- Group **3** have **3e in final shell**
	- Group **7** have **7e in final shell**
		- All INCOMPLETE!
- In order to complete this valence shell, They bond with other atoms

# Ionic Bonding:
- Is a type of bonding in which **Metals** and **Non-Metals** bond by giving/taking electrons (forming ions) 
	- **Cations->** $\ce{Na^+}$
	- **Anions->** $\ce{Cl^-}$
- This a **Giant Lattic Structure**
	- A regular arrangement of Positive and Negative Ions
- The force of bond is electrostatic force between the ions

### Physical Properties
- High melting point. - High force of attraction due to electrostatic attraction b/w oppositely charged ions
- Compounds are brittle (Break instead of Bending)
- **Ionic Bonded** Substance can conduct electricity in **liquid / aqueous form**

# Covelant Bonding

- This is formed due to the bonding of **Non Metals** in which they **share** pair of electrons between them leading to a Noble gas structure
- Electrostatic force due to the elctrons shared
- ![[O levels/attatchments/Untitled 2022-10-04 18.31.01.excalidraw]]
### Properties
- Low Melting point and Boiling point
- Poor conductors of electricity and heat -> **Weak Inter Molecular Force**
- **Giant Covelant Structure**
	- Many Covelant bonds are formed to create a giant structure
		- High Melting Point and Boiling Point
		- **Lattice** Or in a pattern!

## Metallic Structures
- Metallic Bonding - The electrostatic Attraction between positive ions in **Giant Metallic Lattice** and a **sea of delocalised electrons**
- ![[O levels/attatchments/Untitled 2022-10-04 18.40.40.excalidraw]]
- They have strong electrostatics force
	- High melting point and BP
	- They are quite strong
		- **but** They can slide over eachother
			- Hence They have Malleability and Ductility
- Delocalised Electrons
	- Good Electrical Conductivity
