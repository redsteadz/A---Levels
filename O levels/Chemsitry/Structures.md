## Ionic Bonding:
- Is a type of bonding in which **Metals** and **Non-Metals** bond by giving/taking electrons (forming ions) 
- This a **Giant Structure**
- The force of bond is electrostatic force between the ions
![[O levels/attatchments/Untitled 2022-10-04 18.20.55.excalidraw]]
### Physical Properties
- High melting point. - High force of attraction due to electrostatic attraction b/w oppositely charged ions
- Compounds are brittle (Break instead of Bending)

# Covelant Bonding

- This is formed due to the bonding of **Non Metals** in which they **share** electrons between them
- Electrostatic force due to the elctrons shared
- ![[O levels/attatchments/Untitled 2022-10-04 18.31.01.excalidraw]]
### Properties
- Low Melting point and Boiling point
- Poor conductors of electricity and heat
- **Giant Covelant Structure**
	- Many Covelant bonds are formed to create a giant structure
		- High Melting Point and Boiling Point

## Metallic Structures
- Metallic Elements - Positive Metal Ions and Negative Electrons have a strong electrostatic force
- ![[O levels/attatchments/Untitled 2022-10-04 18.40.40.excalidraw]]
- They have strong electrostatics force
- High melting point and BP
- They are quite strong
