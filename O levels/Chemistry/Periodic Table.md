## Arrangement
- Comprised of 2 Parts
	- Groups(Columns)
		- The group No. tells us the amount of **electrons** in the valence(last) shell of an atom
		- Hence elements from the same group. React similarly
		- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Periodic Table 2022-11-15 17.19.03.excalidraw]]
	- Periods(Rows)
		- Represent the Number of shells of an atom
- In order of increasing proton no/atomic number

# Group 1 Elements
- Known as Alkali Metals
	- They behave as Alkalis
- Metals - White Solids
- Form a charge of $\ce{X^+}$ 
- Soft Metals, MP/BP relatively low for a metal
- Colorless Solution
- Physical Trends

	-    the atoms become larger
	-   the outer electron becomes further from the nucleus
	-   the force of attraction between the nucleus and the outer electron decreases
	-   the outer electron is lost more easily

## Group 7

## Characteristics
- Non metals
- 7e in their outer most shell
- Colors Substances
- Hydrogen Halides are strong Acids

## Transition Elements
![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Periodic Table 2022-11-21 10.12.36.excalidraw]]
- Metals
	- High Density
	- High Melting Points
	- Metallic Structure
- Transition Element specific
	- Variable Oxidation States
		- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Periodic Table 2022-11-21 10.16.18.excalidraw]]
		- These states, are colored. And colored differently
	- They are usually used as catalysts

| Transition Element/Compound | Usage                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Vanadium PentaOxide         | Contact Process (SO3) |
| Iron                        | Haebers Process (NH3)|

# Noble Gases (Group 0/8)
These gases are unreactive because they have a complete shell
- They make no bonds so they are **monoatomic**
- **Unreactive**
### Uses:
- **Helium**- filling balloons: less dense than air so the balloons float and He is non-flammable
- Neon – advertising signs 
- argon/krypton/xenon- gas in filament lamps: inert 
- **argon**- shielding gas in welding: denser than air so keeps air off of metal and inert so metal won’t oxidise
