**Electrolysis:** Is the decomposition of an ionic compound, when molten or an aqueous solution, by the passage off electric current
![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Electrochemistry 2023-01-03 19.15.39.excalidraw]]
- Anode is the Positive Electrode
- Cathod is the Negative Electrode
- The Electrolyte is a molten or aqueous substance that undergoes electrolysis

- In order to figure out the ions of any electrolyte, Look at **2 things**
	- Is it a liquid?
		- Break the Ionic compound into it's ions
		- $\ce{Br^{-} , Pb^{2+}}$ 
- **Cathode Reaction**
	- Cation (+ve charged ion). $\ce{Pb^{2+}}$ 
- **Anode Reaction
	- Anion (-ve charged ion)  $\ce{Br^-}$
- **KEEP IN MIND**

## Concentrated Aqueous  Sodium Chloride
$\ce{NaCl(aq)}$
- This (aq) Means that there is another pair of ions
	- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Electrochemistry 2023-01-06 17.22.50.excalidraw]]
- Now there is another issue!
	- **Cathode Reaction** - Cations (+ve ions)
		- $\ce{H^{+}, Na^{+}}$
	- **Anode Reaction** - Anions (-ve ions)
		- $\ce{OH^{-}, Cl^{-} }$
- **Reaction ONLY happens for one on each electrode**
	- THEY ARE IN A COMPETITION
- **Cathodes Rule**
	- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/th.webp]]
	- **The more reactive an element is, the more IT LIKES TO STAY IN IONIC FORM**
		- $\ce{H^+}$ wins!
- **Anodes Rule**
	- If solution is Concentrated & Halide is present (Group 7)
		- Halide wins!
		- $\ce{Cl^-}$
	- If solution is dilute 
		- Hydroxide wins
