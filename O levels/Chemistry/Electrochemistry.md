**Electrolysis:** Is the decomposition of an ionic compound, when molten or an aqueous solution, by the passage off electric current
![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Electrochemistry 2023-01-03 19.15.39.excalidraw]]
- Anode is the Positive Electrode
- Cathode is the Negative Electrode
- The Electrolyte is a molten or aqueous substance that undergoes electrolysis

**Molten Lead(II) Bromide**

- In order to figure out the ions of any electrolyte, Look at **2 things**
	- Is it a liquid?
		- Break the Ionic compound into it's ions
		- $\ce{Br^{-} , Pb^{2+}}$ 
- **Cathode Reaction**
	- Cation (+ve charged ion). $\ce{Pb^{2+}}$ 
- **Anode Reaction
	- Anion (-ve charged ion)  $\ce{Br^-}$
- **KEEP IN MIND**

## Concentrated Aqueous  Sodium Chloride
$\ce{NaCl(aq)}$
- This (aq) Means that there is another pair of ions
	- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Electrochemistry 2023-01-06 17.22.50.excalidraw]]
- Now there is another issue!
	- **Cathode Reaction** - Cations (+ve ions)
		- $\ce{H^{+}, Na^{+}}$
	- **Anode Reaction** - Anions (-ve ions)
		- $\ce{OH^{-}, Cl^{-} }$
- **Reaction ONLY happens for one on each electrode**
	- THEY ARE IN A COMPETITION
- **Cathodes Rule**
	- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/th.webp]]
	- **The more reactive an element is, the more IT LIKES TO STAY IN IONIC FORM**
		- $\ce{H^+}$ wins!
- **Anodes Rule**
	- If solution is Concentrated & Halide is present (Group 7)
		- Halide wins!
		- $\ce{Cl^-}$
	- If solution is dilute 
		- Hydroxide wins

**Dilute Sodium Chloride**
Dilute sodium chloride indicates, The Sodium chloride was dissolved in water
NaCl(aq)

**Ions Present**
- $\ce{Na^{+}, H^{+}, Cl^{-}, OH^{-}}$
**Cathode Reaction (REACTIVITY SERIES)**
- As hydrogen is less reactive than Sodium, It goes to the Cathode
- $\ce{2H^{+} + 2e^{-} -> H2}$
**Anode Reaction (Concentration - Halide)** 
- Dilute solution!
	- So even though it has a halide present
- $\ce{OH^-}$ will win
- $\ce{4OH^{-} -> 2H2O + O2 + 4e^{-}}$
- ![[O levels/Chemistry/attatchments/Electrochemistry 2023-01-08 18.22.54.excalidraw]]
## Dilute Sufuric Acid
$\ce{HCl, HNO3, H2SO4(aq)}$  
**Ions Present**
$\ce{H^{+}, OH^{-}, H^{+}, SO4^2-}$ 
**Cathode**
$\ce{2H+ +2e^{-} ->H2}$ 
**Anode (Concentration & Halide)**
- Not  Concentrated
- No Halides (Group 7) present
- $\ce{OH^-}$ wins!
- $\ce{4OH^{-} -> 2H2O + O2 + 4e^{-}}$
| $\ce{H+}$ | $\ce{OH-}$ |
| --------- | ---------- |
| 2         | 1          |
