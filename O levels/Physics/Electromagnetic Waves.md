- The electromagnetic spectrum is arrange in a specific order based on the wavelengths or frequencies 
-  The main grouping of the continuous electromagnetic (EM) spectrum are
	- Radio Waves
	- Micreowaves
	- Infrared 
	- Visible light (red, orange yellow green blue indigo and violet)
	- Ultraviolet
	- X-Rays 
	- Gamma rays
**The vel in a vacuum is 3x10^8 m/s**

- The higher the frequency the higher the energy of the radiation
- Radiation with higher energy is 
	- Highly ionising
	- Harmful to cells and tissues causing cancer (e.g UV, X-rays, Gamma Rays)
- Radiation with lower energy is:
	- Useful for communications
	- Less harmful to humans
- **R**aging **M**artians **I**nvaded **V**enus **U**sing **X**-ray **G**uns
- Radio waves are long wavelengths
- Gamma rays are short wavelengths

- Electromagnetic Waves are defined as
	- Transverse waves that transfer energy from the source of the waves to an absorber
- All electromagnetic waves share the following properties
	- They are all transverse
	- They can travel through a vacuum
	- They all travel at the same speed in a vacuum 
- The 7 types of electromagnetic waves together force a continuous spectrum

- The speed off electromagnetic waves in a vacuum is 3x10^8
- This is approximately the same speed as electromagnetic waves in air

### Radio Wave & Microwaves
- These two parts of the spectrum share a lot of similarities and applications
	- Their main uses concern wireless communiations - in fact many things that people often assume use radio waves actually use microwaves (WiFi, radars, mobile phones, satellites)
- At very high intensities microwaves can also be used to heat up things
	- e.g Microwave oven

### Infrared
- Infrared is emitted by warm objects and can be detected using special cameras (thermal imaging cameras) These can be used in industry, in research and also in medicine
- Many security cameras are capapble of seeing slightly into the infrared part of the spectrum and this can be used to allow them to see in the dark
	- Infrared light are used to illuminate an area without being seen, which is then detected using the camera
- Remote controls also have small Infrared LEDs
- They also travel down fibre optic cables more efficiently than visible light

### Visible Light
- Visible light is the only part of the electromagnetic spectrum that the human eye can see
- The human eye can detect wavelengths from 750nano metres (red light)  up to 380 nanometers (violet light)

### Ultraviolet
- Ultraviolet rays is responsible to give you a sun tan
- It is used in fluoresence and lamps

### X-rays 
- The most obvious use of x-rays is in medicine
- X-rays are able to pass through most body tissues but are absorbed by the denser parts like bones

### Gamma Rays
- Gamma rays are very dangerous and can be used to kill cells and living tissues
- This property is utilised in both cancer detection and treatment
	- If these gamma rays are carefully aimed at the tissues. They can be effectively destroyed

## Hazards and Dangers of Electromagnetic Waves
- As the frequency of the (EM) waves increases, so does the energy
- Beyond the visible part of the spectrum, The energy becomes large enough to **ionise** atoms
- As a result of this, the danger associated with EM waves increases along with the frequency
	- The shorted wavelength -> The more the frequency -> The more the ionising power
	- Although the **intensity** of a wave also plays an important role
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20230105172900.png]]
	- Becaiuse of ionisation, ultraviolet waves, X-rays and gamma rays can have **hazardous** effects on human tissue
		- The effect depends on the type of radiationa and the size of dose
	- They can damage cells and cause mutations, making them cancerous
- In general EM waves become more dangerous the shorter their wavelength
	- for example radio waves have no known harmful effects while gamma rays can cause cancer and are regarded as extremely dangerous
