## Temperature and Movement
- Temperature
	- The measurement, of how hot or cold something is.
	- **Thermal Energy**  causes the particles to move/vibrate more quickly (**Kinetic Energy**)
- Absolute Zero (-273 C)
	- Is the theoretical temperature in which a substance reaches the least amount of K.E

## Thermal Expansion
- When a substance expands due to increase in thermal energy is called thermal expansion
