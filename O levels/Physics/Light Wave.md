- **Control Variable**
	- Distance of Ray Box from Mirror
	- Width of the light beam
	- Same frequency / wavelength of the light
- **Method**
  1. Set up the apparatus as shown in the diagram
  2. In the middle of the paper use a ruler to mark a straight line of about 10cm long
  3. Use a protractor to draw a 90degree line that bisects (cuts in half) the 10cn line
  4. Place the mirro on the first line as shown in the diagram above
  5. Switch on the ray box and aim a beam of light at the point where the two drawn lines cross at an angle
  6. Use a pencil to makr two positions of the light beam
    1. A point Just after leaving the ray box
    2. The point on the reflected beam about 10cm away from the mirror
  7. Remove the ray box and mirror
  8. Use a ruler to join the two marked positions where the originally drawn lines crosssed
  9. Use the protractor to measure the two angles from the (Normal Line) 90 degree line. The angle for the ray towards the mirror is the angle of incidence and the other angle is of reflection
  10. Repeat the experiment three times with the beam of light aimed at different angles

### The Law Reflection
- Angle Incidence (i) = Angle of reflection (r)
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave.png]]
- Reflection in a plane mirror
	- Image will be same size as the object
	- Image will be the same distance **behind** the mirror as the object is in front of it
	- Directtly in line with the object

## Ray diagram for Refraction
- When drawing refraction ray diagrams, angles are measured between the wavedirection (ray) and a line at 90 degrees to the boundry (Normal Line)
	- The angle of the wave approaching the boundary is called the angle of incidence (i)
	- The angle of the wave leaving the boundary is called the angle of refraction (r)
- When drawing a ray an arrow is used to show the directio of wave
	- Towards the boundary (Incident ray)
	- Away from the boundary (refracted ray)
- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-10 19.24.42.excalidraw]]
- Refraction occurs when light passes a boundary between two different transparent media/medium
- At the boundary, the rays of light undergo a change in direction
- The direction is taken as the angle of hypothetical line called the normal
	- This line is perpendicular to the surface of the boundaries and is usually represented by a straight dashed/dotted line
- The change in direction depends on which media the light rays pass between
	- From less dense to more dense (e.g air to glass), light bends **towards** the normal
	- From more dense to less dense (e.g. glass to air), light bends **away** from the normal
	- When passing along the normal (perpendicular) the light **does not bend** at all
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20221210193340.png]]

- The change in direction occurs due to the change in speed when travelling in different substances
	- When light passes into a denser medium/substance the rays will **will slow down**, hence they bend towards the normal
- The only properties that change are the **speed and wavelength** - FREQUENCY DOESN'T change
	- Different frequencies account for different colors if light (red has a low freq, while blue has hight freq)
	- When light refracts, it does not change color (think of a pencil in a glass of water), Therefore, the freq does not change
- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-10 19.53.44.excalidraw]]

## Experiment to prove Refraction

- **Snell's Law**
	- The refractive index is a number which is related to the speed of light in the material (which is always less than the speed of light in a vacuum)
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-10 19.46.09.excalidraw]]
	- The refractive index is a number that is always larger than 1 and is different for different materials
		- Objects which are more **optially dense** have a higher refractive index, eg. n is abt 2.4 for diamond
		- Objects which are less **opttically dense** have a lower refractive index, eg. n is abt 1.5 for glass
	- Since this is a ration it has **no unit**
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-13 12.05.33.excalidraw]]
	- n = the refractive index of the material 
	- i = angle of incidence of the light
	- r = angle of refraction of the light

## Total Interna Reflection
- Sometimes, when light is moving from a denser medium towards a less dense one, instead of being reracted, all of the light is reflected 
- Total internal reflection occurs when the
  1.  angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle
  2.  the incident material is **denser** than the second material 
     ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-13 12.34.02.excalidraw]]
- Total internal reflection is used in 
	- Optical Fibres
	- Prisms
- **Prisms** are used in a variety of optical instruments, including
- Periscopes
	- A periscope is a device that can be used to see over tall objects
		- It consists of two right angled prisms
		- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20221213125409.png]]
		- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20221213125540.png]]
- Binoculars
- Telescopes
- Cameras

## Critical Angle
- As the angle of incidence is increased, the angle of refraction also increasing until it gets close to 90 degrees
- When the angle of refraction is exactly 90 degrees the light is refracted along the boundary
	- A this point, the angle of incidence is known as the **critical angle**
     ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-13 12.34.02.excalidraw]]
     When it **i** is larger then the critical angle. Total internal reflection occurs

```ad-question
title:Worked Example
A glass cube is held in contact witttth a liquid and a lightt ray is directed at a vertical face of the cube. The angle of incidence at the vertical face is 39degrees and the angle of refraction is 25 degrees as shown in the diagram. The light ray is totally internally reflected for the first time at X
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-15 12.13.25.excalidraw]]
Complete the diagram to show the path of the ray beyond X to the air and calculate critical angle for the glass-liquid boundary
```
- Refractive index and critical angle can be related by using
- $$sin(c) = \frac{1}{n}$$
- You can also write it as 
- $$n = \frac{1}{sin(c)}$$
- This equation shows that The larger the refractive index of a material, the **smaller** the critical angle
- The light rays inside a material with a high refractive index are more likely to be internally reflected
```ad-question
Opals and diamonds are transparent stones used in jewellery. Jewellers shape the stones so that light is reflected inside.Compare the critical angles of opal and diamond and explain which stone would appear to sparkle more.

The refractive index of opal is about 1.5

The refractive index of diamond is about 2.4

## Optical Fibres
Total internal reflection is used to reflect light along optical fibres, meaning they can be used for 
- Communications
- Endoscopes
- Decorative Lamps
- Safety reflectors on bicycles cars and roads
- Light travelling down an optical fibre is totally internally reflected each htime it hits the edge of the fibre

## Features of Lens Diagrams
- Lens diagrams can be described using the following terms
	- Principal Axis
		- **A line which passes through the center off a lens**
	- Focal length
		- **This distance between the centre of the lens and the principal focus**
	- Principal Focus/Focal Point
		- **The point at which rays of light travelling parallel to the principal axis inttersect the principal axis and converge**
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-15 17.19.02.excalidraw]]

### Converging Lenses
- In a converging lens, parallel rays of light are brought to a focus
	- This point is called the principal focus
- This lens is sometimes referred to as **Convex** lens
- The distance from the lens to the principal focus is called the focal length
- **The more the curved lens, the SHORTER the focal length**


### Diverging Lenses
- In a diverging lens, parllel rays of light are made to diverge (spread out) from a point
	- This lens is sometimes referred tto as a concave lens
	- The princippal focus is now the point at which the rays appear to diverge from
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-15 17.28.33.excalidraw]]
	![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20221215173803.png]]

- Images produced by lenses can be one of two types:
	- A real image
	- A virtual Image
- **Real Images**
	- An image that is formed when the light rays from an object converge and meatt eachottther and can be projected onto a screen
-  A real image is one produced by the **convergence** of light towards a focus
-   Real images are always **inverted**
-   Real images can be projected onto pieces of paper or screens
    -   An example of a real image is the image formed on a cinema screen![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/6.3.2-Real-Image.webp]]

- **Virtual Images**
	- An image that is formed when the light rays from an object do no meet but appear to meet behind the lens and cannot be projected onto a screen
- A virtual image is formed by the divergence of light awat from a point
- Virtual Images are always upright
- Virtual images cannot be projected onto a piece of paper or a screen
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20221215175648.png]]

## Converging Lens - Real Images
- Lenses can be used to form images of objects placed in front of them
- The location (and nature) off the image can be found by drawing a ray diagrom
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-16 16.20.51.excalidraw]]
1. Start by drawing a ray going from the top of the object through the centre off the lens. This ray will continue to travel straight
2. The second ray drawn will be parallel to the Principal axis to. When this ray emerges, It will deviate **towards the focal point/principal focus**
3. The image is found at the point where these rays intercepts

## Examples
- If the image is more distanced - further then 2xfocal length, The diagram looks something like this
$$linear-magnification= \frac{height-of-image}{heigth-of-object}$$
- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-16 16.54.51.excalidraw]]
- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-18 17.14.38.excalidraw]]
- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-18 17.19.01.excalidraw]]

## Diverging Lens - Virtual Images
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-18 17.31.40.excalidraw]]

# Examples
- Magnifying Glasses, If the object is placed closer to the lens than the focal length, the emerging rays diverge and a real image is no longer formed
- When viewed from the right hand side of the lens, the emerging rays appear to come from a point on the left
	- This point can be found by extending the rays backwards (virtual rays)
- A virtual Image will be seen at the point where these virtual rays cross
- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave 2022-12-18 17.19.01.excalidraw]]

## Light Dispersion
- White light is a mixture of all the colors of the spectrum
- Each color has a different wavelength (And frequency), making up a very narrow part of the electromagnetic spectrum
- White light may be seperated into all its colors by passing it through a prism
	- Refraction occurs
	- Violet light is refracted the most, while red is refracted the least
	![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Pasted image 20221220121410.png]]
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Light Wave-1.png]]
----------> Decreasing Wavelength -------->
**Wavelength is inversely proportional to Deflection**

- Visible light is defined as the range of wavelengths which are visible to humans
- Visible light is the only part of the spectrum detectable by the human eye
	- However, it only takes up 0.0035% of the whole electromagnetic spectrum
- In the natural world many animals such as birds, bees and certain fish are able to percieve beyond visible light and can see infra-red and UV wavelengths of light
	- **Red has longest wavelength** (And lowest frequency and energy)
	- **Violet has the shortest wavelength** (And the highest frequency and energy
