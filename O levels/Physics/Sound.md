- Sound waves are produced by vibrating sources
- When a sound wave comes in contact with a solid, those vibrations can be **transferred** to the solid
	- for example, sound waves can cause a drinking glass to vibrate
	- If the glass vibrates too much the movement causes the glass to shatter
- Sound is a Longitudinal Waves
	- ![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Sound 2023-01-10 12.08.33.excalidraw]]
- Sound waves require a medium to travel through
	- This means that if there are no molecules, Like in a vacuum. Sound wave cannot trave 
		- In space, Astronauts cannot talk through the space
- **Compression and Rarefractions**
- Logitudinal Waves consist of compression and rarefractions
	- A compression is a region of higher density, a place where the molecules are bunched together
	- A rarefraction is a region of lower density, a place where the molecules are spread out
	![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Sound 2023-01-10 12.18.54.excalidraw]]

- When the waves hit a solid, the variations in pressure cause the surface of the solid to **vibrate** in sync with the sound wave

## Measuring The Speed of Sound
- Sound waves travel at a speed of about $340m/s$ in air at RTP
	- The higher the air temperature the greater the speed of sound
- The speed of sound varies rom $330-350m/s$

### Speed of Sound In Materials
- Sound travels faster in liquids and solids
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Sound 2023-01-10 12.29.50.excalidraw]]

There are several experiments that can be carried out to determine the speed of sound
Three methods are now going to be described
- Apparatus will be in bold

![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Sound 2023-01-10 12.33.36.excalidraw]]

1. Two People stand a distance of 100m apart
2. The distance between them is measured using a **trundle wheel**
3. One persion has **two wooden blocks** which they bang together above their head
4. The second person has a **stopwatch** which they start when they see the first person banging the blocks together and stops when they hear the sound
5. This is then repeated several times and an average value is taken for the time
6. The speed of sound can be calculated using
$$v = \frac{d}{t}$$

#### Echoes
![[O levels/Physics/attatchments/Sound 2023-01-10 12.43.01.excalidraw]]
1. A person stands 50m away from a wall using a **trundle wheel** 
2. The person claps **two wooden blocks** together and listens for the echo
3. The person then starts to clap the blocks toghether repeatedly, in rythm with the echoes
4. A second person has stopwatch and starts timing when they hear one of the claps and stops 20 claps later
5. The process in then repeated and an average time is calulated
6. The distance travelled by the sound between each clap and echo is 2x50m
7. The total distance travelled by the sound during the 20 claps will be 2x50x20
$$v = \frac{d}{t}$$
