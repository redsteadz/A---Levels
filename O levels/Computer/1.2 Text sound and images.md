## Character Sets - ASCII code & Unicode
The ASCII code system (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) was setup in 1963 for use in communication systems and computer systems.
A newer version was setup in 1986. The standard ASCII code character set consists of **7 bit codes** (0 - 127 in denary, 00 - 7F in hexadecimal) that represent the letters, numbers and characters found on a standard keyboard, together with 32 control codes (that use codes to 31 for denary, and 00 to 19 for hexadecimal)
**This table shows part of the ASCII code table (control codes are removed)**

The above examples show that the sixth bit changes from 1 to 0 when comparing the lower case and uppercase of a character. This makes the conversion between the two and easy operation. It is also noticeable that the character sets e.g (a to z), (0 to 9) are grouped together in a sequence which speeds up usability 

**Extended ASCII** uses 8 bit codes (0 to 255 in denary and 0 to FF in hex) This gives another 128 codes to allow for characters in non english alphabets and some graphical characters that are included

**Disadvantages of ASCII**
- It does not represent characters in non western languages, for example Chinese and Urdu/Arabic

- One coding system is called Unicode. Unicode can represent all languages of the world, thus supporting many operating systems, search engines and internet browsers used globally. There is overlap with standard ASCII code, Since the first 128 (English) characters are the same, but Unicode can support several thousand different characters in total. 
- As can be seen in the table and figure, **ASCII uses one byte** to represent a character, Whereas **Unicode will support up to four bytes** per character
- **1byte = 8bits**, 4byte 32bits

- The unicode consortium was setup in 1991 Version 1.0 was published with five goals
	- Create a universal Standard that covered all languages and all writing systems 
	- Produce a more efficient coding system than ASCII
	- Adopt uniform encoding where each character is encoded in 16 bit or 32 bit code
	- Create unambiguous encoding where each 16 bit and 32 bit value always represents the same character
	- Reserve part of the code for private use to enable a user to assign codes for their own characters and symbols (useful for Chinese and japanese character sets)

## 1.2.2 Representation of Sound
Soundwaves are vibrations in the air. The human ear senses these vibrations and interprets them as sound
Each sound waves has a frequency, wavelength and amplitude. The amplitude specifies the loudness of the sound
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Pasted image 20230103173753.png]]
Sound waves vary continuously. This means that sound is analogue. Computers cannot work with analogue data so sound waves neet to be sampled in order to be stored in a computer. Sampling means measuring the amplitude of the sound wave. This is done using an analogue to digital converter
To convert the analogue data to digital, the sound waves are sampled at regular time intervals. The amplitude of the sound cannot be measured precisely so approximate values are stored
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/1.2 Text sound and images-1.png]]
This figure shows a sound wave. X axis shows time intervals when the sound was sampled
and Y axis shows the amplitude of the sample sound to 10
- At interval 1, Amplitude is 10
- At interval 2 Amplitude is 4
- **Because the amplitude range in figure above is 0 to 10** we can use 4 binary bits
- ![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/1.2 Text sound and images 2023-01-03 17.52.13.excalidraw]]
- For example, Amplitude of 9 can be represented by 1001) Increasing the number of possible values used to represent sound amplitude also increases the accuracy of the sampled sound (for example using a range of 0 to 127 gives a much more **accurate** representation of the sound sample than using a range of, 0 to 10)
- The number o bits per sample is known as the **sampling resolution** (also known as the bit depth). So, in our example the sampling resolution is 4bits
- **Sampling rate** is the number of sound samples taken per second. This is measured in hertz (Hz) where 1Hz means 'one sample per second'.
- Using Samples to record a sound clip
	- The amplitude of the sound wave is first determined at set time intervals (the sampling rate)
	- This gives an approximate representation of the sound wave
	- each sample of the sound wave is then encoded as a series of binary digits

- CDs have a 16-bit sampling resolution and a 44.1kHz sample rate - that is 44,100 samples every second. This gives high quality sound reproduction

## 1.2.3 Representation of (Bitmap) images
**Bitmap images** are made up of pixels (picture elements); an image is made up of a two dimensional matrix of pixels. The pixels can take different shapes such as
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/1.2 Text sound and images 2023-01-04 17.40.39.excalidraw]]
Each pixel can be represented as a binary number and so a bitmap image is stored in a computer as a series of binary numbers so that:
- A black and white image only requires 1 bit per pixel - this means that each pixel can be one of two colors, corresponding to either 1 or 0
- If each pixel is represented by 2 bits, then each pixel can be one of four colors (2^2), coressponding to 00, 01, 10, 11
- If each pixel is represented by 3 bits then each pixel can be one of either colors (2^3) corresponding to 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111

The number of bits used to represent each color is called **color depth**
An 8-bit color deph means that each pixel can be one of 256 colors (2^8), Modern computers have a 24 color depth, which means over 16million diferent colors can be represented with x pixels.
**Image resolution** refers to the number of pixels that make up an image; for example an image could contain 4096 x 3072 pixels (12, 582, 912 pixels in total)
The resolution can be varied on many cameras beore taking, for example a digital photograph. Photographs with a lower resolution have less detail than those with a higher resolution. For example
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Pasted image 20230104175406.png]]
The drawbacks of a higher resolution image is that it will have a larger size and may cause problems loading due to internet connection issues
