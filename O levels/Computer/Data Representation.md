## Binary
- Computers use binary representation to represent everything
- 1 and 0's; Base 2 system
	- Any form of data neets to first be converted to binary to be processed by a computer
	- Data is processed using **logic gates and stored in registers**

The Binary system is based on 2 numbers, Thus only two 'values' 0 and 1 can be used in this system, Using the same method as denary, this gives the headings...

**To Denary**
- Powers of 2, And Positions of 1's

## Denary
- Base 10 System
	- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

## Hexadecimal
- Base 16 system
	- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, **ABCDEF**
	- We find it to be more convenient to use as one Hex degit represents four binary digits.
	- The hex num is far easier for humans to remember, copy and work with.
	- **Error Codes**
		- These are often shown i hex values. These numbers refer to the memory location of the error and are usually automatically generated by the computer. The programmer needs to know how to interpret the hexadecimal error codes. Examples of error codes from a Win system are shown:![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation.png]]
	- **MAC Addresses**
	- **IPv6 Addresses**
	- **HTML Color codes**
