- Computers use binary representation to represent everything
- 1 and 0's; Base 2 system
	- Any form of data neets to first be converted to binary to be processed by a computer
	- Data is processed using **logic gates and stored in registers**

The Binary system is based on 2 numbers, Thus only two 'values' 0 and 1 can be used in this system, Using the same method as denary, this gives the headings...

**To Denary**
