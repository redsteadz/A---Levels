## Binary
- Computers use binary representation to represent everything
- 1 and 0's; Base 2 system
	- Any form of data neets to first be converted to binary to be processed by a computer
	- Data is processed using **logic gates and stored in registers**

The Binary system is based on 2 numbers, Thus only two 'values' 0 and 1 can be used in this system, Using the same method as denary, this gives the headings...

**To Denary**
- Powers of 2, And Positions of 1's

## Denary
- Base 10 System
	- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9

## Hexadecimal
- Base 16 system
	- 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9, **ABCDEF**
	- We find it to be more convenient to use as one Hex degit represents four binary digits.
	- The hex num is far easier for humans to remember, copy and work with.
	- **Error Codes**
		- These are often shown in hex values. These numbers refer to the memory location of the error and are usually automatically generated by the computer. The programmer needs to know how to interpret the hexadecimal error codes. Examples of error codes from a Win system are shown:![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation.png]]
	- **MAC Addresses**
		- Media Access control address, This refers to a number which uniquely identifies a device on a network. The MAC address refers to the **network interface card** NIC. Which is part of the device. The MAC address is rarely changed so that a particular device can always be identified no matter where it is.
		- This is usually made up of 48bits. Which are shown as 6 groups of two hexadecimal digits
		- NN-NN-NN-DD-DD-DD;
		- The first half NN-NN-NN is the identity number of the manufacturer of the device
		- The second half DD-DD-DD is the serial number of the device
		- 00 – 14 – 22 which identifies devices made by Dell
		- 00 – 40 – 96 which identifies devices made by Cisco 
		- 00 – a0 – c9 which identifies devices made by Intel, and so on
		- e.g **00-1c-b3-4f-25-fe**
	- **IPv6 Addresses**
		- Each device connected to a network is given an address known as the Internet Protocol (IP) Address. 
		- An IPv4 address is a **32-bit number** written in denary or hexadecimal
			- e.g 109.108.158.1 (or 77.76.9e.01 in hex)
			- IPv4 uses a decimal
		- An IPv6 address is a **128-bit number** broken into 16bit chunks represented by a hexadecimal number
			- e.g a8fb:7a88:fff0:0fff:3d21:2085:66fb:f0fa
			- IPv6 uses a Colon
	- **HTML Color codes**
		- HyperText  Mark-up Language (HTML) is used when writing and developing web pages. HTML isn't a programming language but is simply a mark-up language. A mark-up language is used in the processing, definition and presentation of text.
		- HTML uses tags.
		- HTML is often used to represent colors of text on screen. These are represented by **Hexadecimal Values showing the intensity of Red:Green:Blue** 
		- FF 00 00 - Color is red
		- 00 FF 00 - Color Green
		- 00 00 FF - Color Blue
		- FF 80 00 - Color of Orange
		- 256 x 256 x 256 = 16,777,216 This is range of possible colors
## Addition off Binary Numbers
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation 2022-12-12 17.10.09.excalidraw]]
**Overflow**
Add 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 and 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 (using 8 bits)
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation 2022-12-14 16.12.17.excalidraw]]
This addittion has generated a 9th bi. The 8 bits of the answer are 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 - this gives the denary value 76 which is incorrect, Because the denary value of addition is 332.
The maximum denary value of 8-bit register is 255
The genration fo a 9th bit is a clear that the sum has exceeded this value. This is known as an **overflow error**
- The more bits that can be stored. A larger capacity for holding the number
- e.g 32bit ($2^{32}-1$) 4 294 967 295

## Logical Binary Shifts
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation 2022-12-14 16.31.02.excalidraw]]
- There are two types of Binary Shifts
	- Left : Means you are multiplying by 2
	- Right: Means you are dividing by 2
	- The amount of shifts, Determines the power of the 2
e.g
### Left Shifts
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation 2022-12-19 17.08.48.excalidraw]]
### Right Shift

## Two's Compliment
![[O levels/Computer/attatchments/Data Representation 2022-12-19 17.45.58.excalidraw]]
- The left most bit indicates the sign of the binary number
	- If left most bit is 1 - **It will be Negative**
	- If left most bit is 0 - **It will be Positive**

e.g **Positive Numbers in Two's Complement**
