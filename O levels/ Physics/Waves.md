# General Waves
![[O levels/ Physics/attatchments/Waves.png]]
- **Wave transfers energy, without transferring matter**

	- **Wavelength** The distance covered by a wave, in a single oscillation/cycle
		- Is the distance between two consecutive, identical points such as two consecutive crests
	- **Time Period** Is the Time needed for a wave to complete it's oscillation or cycle
	- **Frequency** is the number of wavelength that pass a point per time
	- **Amplitude** As the maximum distance from the mean position

# Transverse Wave 
- In which the vibration of particles is at **right angles** to the direction of the **energy** transfered
- ![[O levels/ Physics/attatchments/th.webp]]
  1. Electromagnetic Radiation
  2. Waves on surface of water
  3. Seismic S-waves


# Longitudnal
- The direction of vibration is **parallel** to the direction of the energy transfer
- ![[O levels/ Physics/attatchments/th 1.webp]]
  1. Sound Wave
  2. Seismic P waves

- Waves can undergo
	- Reflection at a plane surface
		- ![[O levels/ Physics/attatchments/Waves 2022-11-24 14.17.27.excalidraw]]
			- Waves **reflect** off smooth, plane surfaces rather than getting absorbed
				- Angle of Incidence = Angle of Reflection
			- Rough surfaces scatter the light in all direction, so they appear matte and unreflective
			- **Frequence, wavelength and Speed** are all unchanged

	- Refraction (Due to a change of speed)
		- The **speed** of a wave changes when it enters a new medium (environment)
		- **If** the wave enters a **more optically dense** medium, its speed decreases and it **bends** **towards** the normal
		- **If** the wave enters a **less optically dense** medium, its speed increase and it **bends** **away** from the normal
		- In all cases, the frequency stays the **same** but **wavelength changes**

	- Diffraction through a gap
