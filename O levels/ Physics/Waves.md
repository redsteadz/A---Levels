	- **Wavelength** The distance covered by a wave, in a single oscillation/cycle
		- Is the distance between two consecutive, identical points such as two consecutive crests
	- **Time Period** Is the Time needed for a wave to complete it's oscillation or cycle
	- **Frequency** is the number of wavelength that pass a point per time
	- **Amplitude** As the maximum distance from the mean position

# Transverse Wave 
- In which the vibration of particles is at **right angles** to the direction of the **energy** transfered

  1. Electromagnetic Radiation
  2. Waves on surface of water
  3. Seismic S-waves


# Longitudnal
- The direction of vibration is **parallel** to the direction of the energy transfer
