# Redox Reactions
![[O levels/attatchments/Redox Reactions Syllabus.png]]

**Oxidation Number** Is the Charge on a Molecule/Ion

```ad-note
title:**Rule 1** In its pure elemental form, an atom has an oxidation number of zero.

A Pure **Element** is an atom that is not combined with any other elements. <img src="https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/pure_element.png" alt="Oxidation Number of Pure Elements">
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 2** The oxidation number of an ion is the same as its charge!

An ion is an atom with a charge due to gain or loss of electrons.
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 3** Hydrogen has two possible oxidation numbers +1
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 4** Oxygen has three possible Oxidation numbers -2

```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 5** The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is equal to zero.
