Electrolysis is Dependant on **Which Ions go on Which Electrode**
- Cathode:
	- Reactivity Series:
	- ![[attatchments/Reactivity Series.png]]
	- The **Lesser Reactive Ion wins! and goes to the Cathode**
- Anode:
	- If a Halide (Group-7 Element) is present **&** Concentrated It WINS
	- If it's Dilute $\ce{OH-}$ is released
