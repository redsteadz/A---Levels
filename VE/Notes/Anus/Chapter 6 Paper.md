title: Question 1
Amir has a mixture of iron powder, sand and salt. He'd like to seperate each of these into different containers for his experiments. His teachers says that the best way to seperate them is to find the most appropriate steps.
 **(a)** Suggest how Amir could get seperated iron, sand and salt from the mixture **[5]**
 **(b)** After he has seperated each of them. His teacher says that they are still not 100% completely purified. Why do you think that is the case **[1]**
 **(c)** Iron is a metal, how does it's structure help us prove the following properties; **[4]**
	 - Melting Point - High
	 - Can be Bent
 **(d)** It is said that the Melting point point of non-metals is generally less then metals, Explain why? **[2]**
```

```ad-question
title: Question 2
A group of students were give a bunch of compounds and elements:
**(a)** The students dissolve Strontium Oxide and and dissolve it in water; A student predicts that the pH of the solution is less than 7, Is he correct or incorrect, Give a reason. **[3]**
**(b)** A student does an experiment to test the increase in mass after a reaction, He takes Carbon in a regular bowl in open air and lights it on fire. After the burning stopped he noticed that the carbon was no longer there. What do you think could've happened to the carbon? **[1]**
**(c)** Burning carbon is dangerous, What can be reasonable precausions for this experiment? **[2]**
**(d)** The teacher explains that the experiment was flawed, and could never show an increase in mass. Suggest a reason why the experiment could be flawed? **[1]**
**(e)** The students does the experiment correctly and the data is as shown;
Mass of Carbon + Bowl + Lid = 40.0g
Mass of Bowl + Lid = 36.0g
Find out how much carbon was burnt. **[1]**
