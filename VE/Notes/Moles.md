# Moles
Moles is the study of understanding atoms/compunds/molecules and how they would measure in physical aspects.
With in this chapter you are taught:
- What are moles
- Usage of Moles to find Mass and Volume of Substances
- Understanding Molecular Mass and Atomic Mass
- Using Percentage to find Emparical Formula
- Using Emparcial Formula to find Molecular formula
- Understanding Concentration with respect to Moles

### Definitions;
- **Moles** : Moles is a basic SI Unit which tells us the amount of substance in a body which is $6.023 * 10^{{23}}$ elemental entities. These elemental entities can be atoms, protons, electrons. As long as they are 1 mole. the Avagadros Number will be true
- **Relative Atomic Mass**: Is the mass related to $\frac{1}{12}$ mass of a Carbon-12 atom. 
- **Relative Molecular Mass**: Is the total sum of all the atomic masses present in a molecule ($\ce{H2, O2}$) or a Compound $\ce{NaOH}$
- **Emparical Formula**: Is the simplest whole number ratio of atoms present in a compound/molecule
- **Molecular Formula**: Is the total number of atoms present in a compound/molecule

#### Relative Atomic Mass and Molecular mass
A single relative atomic mass $\frac{1}{12}$ mass of a Carbon-12 atom, the Atomic Mass of which is 12. So a single relative atomic mass is just 1 (Mass of one proton/neutron)
And Hence the Atomic Mass = Relative Atomic Mass!

Molecular Mass can be calculated as such
1. State the atoms present in a compound. e.g $\ce{H2O}$
	H, O
2. State their individual atomic masses
	H = 1, O = 16
3. Multiply by the number of those atoms present and add them up.
	$H = (1 *2) + O=(16*1)$

#### Calculating and Understanding Moles
$1mole = 6.023*10^{{23}}$
What this means is that a single mole will reside $6.023*10^{{23}}$ atoms/electrons/protons and so on. We can calculate Moles by using the formula:
$$
Moles = \frac{Mass}{Molecular/Atomic Mass}
$$
Example:
If we have 10g of $\ce{H2O}$ then:
- Calculate Molecular/Atomic Mass
$H = 1, O = 16$ then we multiply the amount of Atoms present $(1*2)+(16*1)$
$Moles = \frac{10}{18} = 0.55$

##### Mass
````ad-question
This formula can be used to find the Mass of the substance as well!
eg 0.24 moles of NaCl
```ad-note
title:Solution
collapse;true
Molecular mass of NaCl = 58
$0.24 = \frac{Mass}{58}$
$Mass = ~14grams$
````
##### Volume
A rule states that in RTP (Room Temperature Pressure) $24dm^3/mole$ is true
This means that in RTP any gas which is 1 moles will take up $24dm^3$ of Volume
eg.
````ad-question
Find the Volume of 0.4moles of $\ce{CO2}$
```ad-note
title:Solution
collapse:true

We know that $1mole = 24dm^3$
so If we multiply 0.4 moles to both sides we have
$0.4=9.6dm^3$

**Answer** 0.4moles of $\ce{CO2}$ consumes 9.6dm^3
````

#### Emparical Formula
When given Percentage of a substance, We can figure out the Emparical formula like so for each atom we will do;
$$
Moles = \frac{PercentageOfAtomPresentInCompound}{AtomicMassOfAtom}
$$
Simplify this until emparical formula is obtained, Make sure that it is in whole number!

#### Emparical Fomula to Molecular Formula
We can find the Molecular Formula by using it's molecular mass
````ad-question
$\ce{CH4$ is the emparical formula of a Compound. It is give that the Molecular Mass of the compound is 160. Find it's Molecular formula

1. Write down the molecular mass of the emparical formula. In this case it would be
	12+4 = 16
2. Then use the formula;
	$n=\frac{MolecularMassOfCompound}{MolecularMassOfEmparicalFormula}$
	So we have:
	$n=\frac{160}{16}=10$
3. Use the value of n to find the molecular formula as such
	$10(\ce{CH4})=\ce{C10H40}$
````

#### Understanding Concentration with respect to moles:
Concentration is the amount of substance present in a $1dm^3$ volume this can be written like so
- If 2moles of HCl was dropped in $250cm^3$ water the concetration would be
	$\frac{250}{1000}=0.25dm^3$
	then divide the moles by the volume like so
	$\frac{2}{0.25}=8mole/dm^3$
- And hence we obtain the formula:
	$Concentration=\frac{Moles}{Volume}$
	
	This can be used to find out the Moles in a volume when concentration is given or find volume when moles and concentration is given
	
#### Percentage Yield:
Humans are not perfect beings and just like that Chemical Reactions Conducted are also not Perfect this gives a margin of error where The Calculated Amount would be more then the actual made amount. The formula to find percentage yield is 
$$
PercentageYield=\frac{ObtainedMassOfSubstance}{CalculatedMassOfSubstance}*100
$$

##### Percentage Purity:
There is a high chance that things made and or used by us is not pure in order to find the percentage purity  we use the formula

$$
PercentagePurity=\frac{ActualMassOfPureSubstance}{MeasureMassOfImpureSubstance}
$$
