## [[2021-09-17]] Class (Intro To Chemistry):
A brief overview of the syllabus should be told with the following points that are important to be noted:
- P1 - 40 marks, P2 - 75 marks, P3 -  60 marks. Periodic Table is provided in all and Calculator also allowed in all
- P1:
	- The paper woulld be divided into sections which progress as per the requirement of the syllabus meaning the first couple of chapters (Experimental Technique, Atomic Structure, Periodic Table) are all questioned in between 1-10 or 10-20 mcq, This progresses to the end where the 30-40 questions are (Organic Chemistry, Metals, Reactivity series) and so on
	```ad-note

	This means that every chapter is of equal importance and cannot be taken lightly!
	MCQ paper is one of the easiest papers to score marks in but students tend to take it scoffingly and come back with "stupid" mistakes.
	A rule of thumb to solving MCQ is to remember that if you DON'T know the answer, then take all the improbable options out of your consideration
	```

- P2:
	- This paper holds the most marks of 75 and is where students make the most mistakes, in order to fix this issue we will make sure that every concept within the syllabus is cleared and understood down to the core. Remember that chemistry is not hard unless we make it hard. As as many times as necessary, No matter how redundant the question may be. 
	- This paper is divided into 2 sections  Section A has all questions necessary to be solved and needs to be done with care, Section B four questions of which 3 are necessary to be solved.
	```ad-note

	Usually these questions are related to the previous parts so make sure that the previous parts are indeed correct, If you are sure that they are not connected then you may complete the later part with no worry of the former
	```

- P4:
	- Paper 4 is a paper that is HEAVILY based on the chapted of Experimental Chemistry and will be looked at much later in the syllabus in detail when understand of chemicals is much better. But this paper requires an astoute observation and understanding of how chemicals would behave and why, what apparatus was used and what experimental Technique was utilized

	#### How to prepare Chemistry and what misconceptions are told:
	Chemistry is absolutely not a diffictult subjects and can become one of the most fun and easiest subjects you'll experience to this date.
	The reason why people think that chemistry is difficult is because at first chemistry seems very **foreign.** By this I mean that you do not observe chemistry with your human eye as easily as you can observed physics around the world.
	
	So why is chemistry easy? Because it is a subject of concept. And it is you who will need to clear them with my help, And these concepts will start to become very intriguing when you realise how everything can be connected to eachother with the power of chemistry.
	
	Now this is how we will be completing Chemistry in a well mannered order.

Notes like these will be made and given out to you in periodic succession. But your notes are what matters most. These are the ones that need to be customized to your most suitable liking. My lecture will be recorded and provided to you with the PDF of the work done in that lecture. Although it is not advantageous to you if you don't take your own notes. Why:
- When you reach college you will be making, composing notes at your own will. It's better to learn now what to and what not to note.
- These notes will be accustomed to your liking and hence will be much easier for you to digest and review
```

I will be as thorough as the syllabus allows when completing these chapters, When a chapter is finished we will look over the Past Papers, At the end of the month there will be a short test of either theory, multiple choice, or even experimental chemistry that would test your knowledge of what you learned in that month and if you understand it correctly

**Most Important of All** It is you who studies and only you who will get the grades for your success, No matter what I make/do. Your work is what counts most. Remember that and work hard towards your goal. Also be sure to take necessary breaks as rest and relaxations is a part of human neccessity
