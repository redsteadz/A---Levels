TARGET DECK: Chemistry

Istopes::Atoms of the same element with the same amount of protons and different neutrons
<!--ID: 1630568028797-->

Atomic_Radius:: &uarr; Down the Group, &darr; Across the period 
<!--ID: 1630568138144-->

Ionisation Energy::  The **Ionisation** **Energy** (**IE**) of an element is the amount of energy required to remove **one mole** of electrons from **one mole** of gaseous atoms of an element to form **one mole** of gaseous ions
<!--ID: 1630568292843-->

Principal Quantum Number(n):: Which shell is holding the electron, can be used to find the max number of electrons, Also more n = &uarr; Energy Levels ? $2n^2$ 
<!--ID: 1630591520274-->


Asmuthal Quantum Number(l) :: The Orbital in which the electron resides in, $l= n-1$ s = 0, p = 1, d = 2, so if n = 2, L can be either 0 or 1, (s, p)
<!--ID: 1630591520281-->


Magnetic Quantum Number (m) :: Every subshells and every orbitals represented as a magnetic value
<!--ID: 1630591520287-->


Spin Quntum Number (m) :: It is the spin of electrons, Spind-up and Spin-down. As told by the values of $\overset{+}{-}\dfrac{1}{2}$ 
<!--ID: 1630591520293-->


Kinetic Energy:: The measure of the motion of atoms, molecules and ions in a chemical substance
<!--ID: 1630591520299-->


Potential Energy:: The measure of how strongly these particles attract one another
<!--ID: 1630591520305-->

**Unified Atomic Mass:**::Defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12
<!--ID: 1631017153312-->


**Reletive atomic masses (Ar) or atomic weight**:: is a dimensionless physical quantity defined as the ratio of the average mass of atoms of a chemical element in a given sample to the unified atomic mass constant. The atomic mass constant is defined as being 1/12 of the mass of a carbon-12 atom.
<!--ID: 1631017153322-->


**Relative Isotopic Mass**: Is the atomic mass of an isotope relative to the unified atomic mass (1/12 of Carbon-12)

**Relative Molecular Mass/Formula Mass:**:: The relative molecular mass of a substance is equal to the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the elements making up the chemical compound
<!--ID: 1631017153331-->


**Moles:**:: One mole is the amount that contains the same number of atoms as there are in 12g of Carbon-12 Avagadros Constant
