$cos(\frac{\pi}{2}-\Theta) = sin(\Theta)$
$sin(\frac{\pi}{2}-\Theta) = cos(\Theta)$

Remember to simplify as much as possible, Including converting to a MIXED **fraction** where ever possible

#### Composite functions and their Domain and Range:
![[Pasted image 20211010170517.png]]
If domain of $g(x) = d_g$ then $d_g = fg(x)$
fg exists only when **range** of g is within the **domain** of f
By these rules, The **range** of fg can be found!

- Understand making graphs of $e^x,ln^x$ And how to calculate their Domain and Range
#### $ln(x)$
aln(x + b) + c
a is stretch, bending of the graph
b is the asymptote (-b) when b= -7, (-(-7)) means asymptote would be on 7, x>7 - Domain
![[Pasted image 20211010143554.png]]
c is y shift (-c) moves the graph down, $ln(x-7) + 4$
c is like the "Base line" when it is moved up the entire graph just moves up, So here for example the point (8,0) would be (8,4) and so on

#### $e^{{ax-c}} + b$
b is the asymptote on the x axis, so f(x) > b 
c is the x movement, like so (-z) if z = -10, then the the MINIMUM point would be at (10) considering that coefficient of x is 1
a is the stretch, so in order to find minimum point $ax - b = 0$

title:Log

- Log of $-1$ is NON EXISTENT!
- Sometimes the answers are quiet obvious
- Remember to simplify Co-ef with log, and only then +- with another log. e.g:
	- $2log_315-log_35$ = $log_345$
```ad-question
- By changing the base of $log_{{2a}}4$, express ($log_{{2a}}4$)(1 + $log_{{a}}2$) as a single logarithm to base a. **ANS** $log_{{a}}4$
```

title:Coordinate


- Remember to take (-) in coordinate of a point
- Write the correct Area formula (A B C D A)
- When working with $\pi$ remember to change setting of calculator RADIAN
```ad-question
The point P lies on the line joining A(-1,-5) and B(11, 13) such that AP = $\dfrac{1}{3}$AB
-  (i) Find the equation of the line perpendicular to AB and passing through P.
- **Solution** Make DISTANCE equation with another LINE equation. Equate the two, P(3,1)

title: Trigonometry

- Graphs Making!
#### Sin:

- Make sure that your negative values are taken correctly
- Do not mix up $sin^2(x)$ and $sin(x)$
- Test values to make sure that $cos/sin/tan(x)= y$ Where y is constant. And the the value of x is within range!

Remember that $sin(b\pi)$ where b is the number of cycles ! 
if $sin(2\pi)$ then 2 cycles are done till 2$\pi$

title: Series

### Binomial Expansions &check;
$(a+b)^n=a^n + C^n_1*a^{{n-1}}b + C^n_2*a^{{n-2}}b^2$

Where C is combination with the formula:
$C^{{n}}_r=\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!r!}$
This is where $(n-r)!$ has an adverse affect with $n!$
The bigger r is, the more n(n-1).... there are eg;
- Do not forger the $r!$ as denominator!
$\dfrac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{4!}$

### Arithmatic Expansions:
k = the $num^th$ term, a = first term, d = $T_{{k}}-T_{{k+1}}$. Difference, n = number of terms
- Remember that when asking for sum between two sums, The wording is important, `The sum of the fifteenth through twenty-fifth terms` is 15 inclusive, so it would be $S{{25}}-S_{{14}}$
the $k$th term = $a+(k-1)d$
the $last$ term = $l$ = $a+(n-1)d$
the sum of the terms = $S_n = \dfrac{n}{2}(a+l) = \dfrac{n}{2}[2a + (n-1)d]$

### Geometric Series:
k = the $num^th$ term, a = first term, r = common ratio

the $k$th term = $ar^{{k-1}}$
the $last$ term = $ar^{{n-1}}$
the sum of the terms = $S_n = \dfrac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} =\dfrac{a(r^n-1)}{r-1}$  

Condition for geometric series to converge $-1<r<1$
$S_\infty = \dfrac{a}{1-r}$
Range is non inclusive of last term
If you have
2000 to 2011 to find. All inclusive! Then use (difference +1)

title: Differentiation
#### Formulas
$\frac{dx}{dy}(x^n) =nx^{{n-1}}$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(f(x)^n) =f^`(x)*f(x)^{{n-1}}$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(\sqrt{x^n+5}) =\frac{f^`(x)}{2\sqrt{x^n+5}}$

**Trigs Functions**
$\frac{dx}{dy}(sin(f(x)) =f(x)'*cos(x)$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(cos(f(x))) =f(x)'*-sin(x)$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(tan(f(x))) =f(x)'*sec^2(x)$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(sin^n(x)) =nsin^{{n-1}}(x)f(x)'$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(cos^n(x)) =-ncos^{{n-1}}(x)f(x)'$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(tan^n(x)) =-ntan^{{n-1}}(x)f(x)'$

**Logarithm Functions**
$\frac{dx}{dy}(e^{{ax+b}})) =f(x)'*e^{{ax+b}}$
$\frac{dx}{dy}(ln(ax+b)) =\frac{f(x)'}{ax+b}$


- When asked to find an approximate change of y when x changes FROM v to u, 
then do the following
$\frac{dy}{d(v)} = dy / d(x)$ This equates to
$\frac{dy}{d(v)} * d(x) = dy$ where the *small* change in $x/d(x)$ is u!

- Remember there will be no negative value for quantities where negatives can't exit e.g (length, mass, weight)
- The most obvious answer is usually the correct answer! Remember that $x^2 = -b$ is a not real number. And also remember $bx = 0,x=0$ Is a solution. So don't miss it

```ad-note
title: Vectors
- Remember the matrix of:
$$
\left(\begin{matrix}
  x  \\
  y 
\end{matrix}\right)
$$
And **NOT** the other way around you dumb baka
- When given a vector equation and you need to find another one, Then you can use:
$i_2 + j_2 =d_2 * \frac{1}{d_1}* (i_1 + j_1)$

```


```ad-note
title:Integration

- When facing an integration with an overall square, Solve the square then solve the integration $(x^{{1/3}} - 3)^2$ - **THIS IS REDUNDANT AS EXPLAINED BY THE FUNCTION RULE $(f(x))^2$ cannot be integrated like that.**
$\frac{3 x^{\frac{5}{3}}}{5} - \frac{9 x^{\frac{4}{3}}}{2} + 9 x$

- Remember to know the difference between $k$ as in constant, ang $f(x)$ or g(x)
In for example:
![[Pasted image 20210928232230.png]]
here there are two functions like so $f(x)-g(x)$

- $2xsinx$ is $2x * sinx$

title:Attempt Notes:
- Switched the matric of (x,y) in vectors causing an answer to be wrong
- When asking for **EXACT** answer, This means that DONOT give answer in decimal You need to be as precise as possible
