Assalam O Alaikum dear students, I hope you all are doing well. I've made a video on how I would design a plan and my thought process on it with the objective to help all of you to make your own personal plan or schedule, Now there is less time in exam and hence this video will not prioritize on long term Spaced revision and on the other hand will focus more on how you can use your remaining time more efficiently, What to avoid and what programs/tools to use.

 If it you are unable to watch the video then a basic summary is:
- To make a Subject diverse Plan
- Have Objectives for each day, and do different subject combo every day
- Revise and then after a certain period of gap, Make notes and do Past papers
- Make Weekly notes, Summarizing what new things you've learnt and should keep in mind and also attempting (possibly unique) questions for the chapters learnt in that week
- Continue this and on the following week do the same except also revise the previous weeks chapter and their past papers. (In a reduced quantity)
- Take advantage of tools that are at your disposal

The Tools:
**Obsidian** - Is a fantastic note taking program for long term and even short term notes that integrates with many things (Can make calendar schedules, daily notes, weekly notes and much much more) 
**Notion** - A multi-utility program you can use to; Take notes, make calendars and schedules. Recommended for monthly plan

**Most important - Anki**, As most students here are O2 this program would highly benefit learning large and numerous dates, names, figures and so on.
