## 5 Practical assessment 

### Introduction 

 Teachers should ensure that learners practise experimental skills throughout their course of study. As a guide, learners should spend at least 20 per cent of their time doing practical work individually or in small groups. This 20 per cent does not include the time spent observing demonstrations of experiments. 

 The practical work that learners do during their course should aim to: 

- provide learning opportunities so they develop the skills they need to carry out experimental and investigative     work 

- reinforce their learning of the theoretical subject content of the syllabus 

- instil an understanding of the relationship between experimentation and theory in scientific method 

- be enjoyable, contributing to the motivation of learners. 

 Candidates’ experimental skills will be assessed in Paper 3 and Paper 5. In each of these papers, the questions may be based on physics not included in the syllabus content, but candidates will be assessed on their practical skills rather than their knowledge of theory. Where appropriate, candidates will be given any additional information that they need. 

### Paper 3 Advanced Practical Skills 

 Paper 3 is a timetabled, laboratory-based practical paper focusing on the experimental skills of: 

- manipulation, measurement and observation 

- presentation of data and observations 

- analysis, conclusions and evaluation. 

 Centres should refer to the document ‘How to manage your sciences practical exams’ for advice on making entries and organisation of candidates for practical exams. 

 Paper 3 consists of two questions, each of 1 hour and each of 20 marks. 

 Question 1 will be an experiment requiring candidates to collect data, to plot a graph and to draw conclusions. 

 Question 2 will be an experiment requiring candidates to collect data and to draw conclusions, but may or may not include the plotting of a graph. In the second question, the experimental method to be followed will be inaccurate, and candidates will be required to evaluate the method and suggest improvements. 

 The two questions will be set in different areas of physics. No prior knowledge of the theory will be required.

#### Expectations for each skill (Paper 3) 

#### Manipulation, measurement and observation 

 Successful collection of data Candidates should be able to: 

- set up apparatus correctly without assistance from the supervisor 

- follow instructions given in the form of written instructions and diagrams (including circuit diagrams) 

- use their apparatus to collect an appropriate quantity of data 

- repeat readings where appropriate 

- make measurements using common laboratory apparatus, such as millimetre scales, protractors, top-pan     balances, newton meters, analogue or digital electrical meters, measuring cylinders, calipers*, micrometer     screw gauges and thermometers 

- use a stop-watch to measure intervals of time, including the period of an oscillating system by timing an     appropriate number of consecutive oscillations 

- use both analogue scales and digital displays. 

 * Where calipers are required in the examination, centres may provide either vernier or digital calipers. Candidates should be familiar with the type of calipers provided. 

 Some candidates will be unable to set up their apparatus without help and may ask for assistance from the supervisor. Supervisors will be given clear instructions on what assistance may be given to candidates, but this assistance should never go beyond the minimum necessary to enable candidates to take some readings: under no circumstances should help be given with the presentation of data, analysis or evaluation sections. All assistance must be reported to the Examiners by recording details of the help given on the supervisor’s report, and candidates who require assistance will not be awarded full credit for the successful collection of data. 

 Quality of data Candidates should be able to: 

- make and record accurate measurements 

- make measurements that span the largest possible range of values within the limits either of the equipment     provided or of the instructions given. 

 Marks will be awarded for measured data in which the values obtained are reasonable. In some cases, the award of the mark will be based on the scatter of points on a graph; in other cases, the candidate’s data may be compared with information supplied by the supervisor or known to the Examiners. The Examiners will only consider the extent to which the candidate has affected the quality of the data: allowances will be made where the quality of data is limited by the experimental method required or by the apparatus used.

38 [http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel](http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel) Back to contents page 

#### Presentation of data and observations 

 Table of results Candidates should be able to: 

- present numerical data and values in a single table of results 

- record all data in the table 

- draw up the table in advance of taking readings so that they do not have to copy up their results 

- include in the table of results columns for raw data and for values calculated from them 

- use column headings that include both the quantity and the unit and that conform to accepted scientific     conventions. 

 As an example of accepted scientific convention in column headings, if the quantity being measured is current in milliamperes, then ‘ I / mA’ would be the usual way to write the column heading, but ‘ I in mA’ or ‘ I (mA)’ or ‘current / mA’ would be allowed. Headings such as ‘ I mA’ or just ‘mA’ are not acceptable. The quantity or the unit or both may be written in words rather than symbols. Conventional symbols or abbreviations (such as p.d.) may be used without explanation. 

 Recording of data, observations and calculations Candidates should be able to: 

- record raw readings of a quantity to the same degree of precision 

- calculate other quantities from their raw data 

- show their working in calculations, and the key steps in their reasoning 

- use and justify the correct number of significant figures in calculated quantities. 

 For example, if one measurement of length in a column of raw data is given to the nearest millimetre, then all the lengths in that column should be given to the nearest millimetre. The degree of precision used should be compatible with the measuring instrument used: it would be inappropriate to record a distance measured on a millimetre scale as either ‘2 cm’ or ‘2.00 cm’. 

 When a value is calculated from measured quantities (except by addition or subtraction), the appropriate number of significant figures for the calculated value usually depends on the measured quantity with the least number of significant figures. If this quantity has n significant figures, then n or n +1 significant figures are appropriate for the calculated value. 

 For example, if values of a potential difference and of a current are measured to 2 and 4 significant figures respectively, then the corresponding resistance should be given to 2 or 3 significant figures, but not 1 or 4. The number of significant figures may, if necessary, vary down a column of values for a calculated quantity. 

 Graph: Layout Candidates should be able to: 

- clearly label graph axes with both the quantity and the unit, following accepted scientific conventions 

- choose scales for graph axes such that the data points occupy at least half of the graph grid in both _x_ - and     _y_ -directions 

- use a false origin where appropriate 

- choose scales for the graph axes that allow the graph to be read easily, such as 1, 2 or 5 units to a 2 cm square 

- place regularly-spaced numerical labels along the whole of each axis at least every 2 cm. 

 The accepted scientific conventions for labelling the axes of a graph are the same as for the column headings in a table of results.

Back to contents page [http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel](http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel) 39 

 Graph: Plotting of points Candidates should be able to: 

- plot all their data points on their graph grid to an accuracy of better than 1 mm. 

 Points should be finely drawn with a sharp pencil, but must still be visible. A fine cross or an encircled dot is suitable; plotted points should have a diameter of less than 1 mm. 

 Graph: Trend line Candidates should be able to: 

- draw straight lines of best fit or curves to show the trend of a graph 

- draw tangents to curved trend lines. 

 The trend line should show an even distribution of points on either side of the line along its whole length. Lines should be finely drawn, continuous, and with a thickness of less than 1 mm, and should not contain kinks. If necessary, candidates may identify one point as anomalous and ignore this point when drawing the line. The anomalous point must be identified, e.g. circled or labelled. 

#### Analysis, conclusions and evaluation 

 Interpretation of graph Candidates should be able to: 

- relate straight-line graphs to equations of the form _y_ = _mx_ + _c_ , and derive expressions that equate to the     gradient and/or the _y_ -intercept of their graphs 

- read the coordinates of points on the trend line of a graph 

- determine the gradient of a straight-line graph or of a tangent to a curve 

- determine the _y_ -intercept of a straight-line graph or of a tangent to a curve, including where these are on     graphs with a false origin. 

 When a gradient is to be determined, the points on the line chosen for the calculation should be separated by more than half of the length of the line drawn. 

 In cases where the y -intercept cannot be read directly from the y -axis, it is expected that the coordinates of a point on the line and the gradient will be substituted into y = mx + c to determine the y -intercept 

 Estimating uncertainties Candidates should be able to: 

- estimate the absolute uncertainty in measurements 

- express the uncertainty in a measurement as an absolute or percentage uncertainty, and translate between     these forms 

- express the absolute uncertainty in a repeated measurement as half the range of the repeated readings, where     this is appropriate.

- identify and describe the limitations in an experimental procedure 

- identify the most significant sources of uncertainty in an experiment.

- suggest modifications to an experimental arrangement that will improve the accuracy of the experiment or to     extend the investigation to answer a new question 

- describe these modifications clearly in words or diagrams. 

 Candidates’ suggestions should be realistic, so that in principle they are achievable in practice in a school laboratory. The suggestions may include the use of other apparatus or different procedures, but not a different experiment. The suggested modifications may relate to sources of uncertainty identified by the candidate. Improvements that could have been made with the apparatus provided while following the instructions in the question will not normally gain credit. 

#### Administration of Paper 3 

 Detailed regulations on the administration of Cambridge International practical examinations are contained in the Cambridge Handbook. 

 Details of the specific requirements for apparatus and materials for a particular examination are given in the confidential instructions which are sent to centres several weeks prior to the examination. Centres should contact Cambridge International if they believe the confidential instructions have not been received. 

 It is the responsibility of centres to provide the apparatus for practical examinations. Cambridge is not able to supply apparatus directly or provide advice on local suppliers of apparatus.

### Paper 5 Planning, Analysis and Evaluation 

 Paper 5 will be a timetabled written paper, focusing on the higher-order experimental skills of planning, analysis and evaluation. 

 This examination will not require laboratory facilities. 

 To prepare candidates for this exam, it should be emphasised that candidates will need extensive experience of laboratory work of A Level standard. In particular, learners cannot be taught to plan experiments effectively unless, on a number of occasions, they are required to: 

- plan an experiment 

- perform the experiment according to their plan 

- evaluate what they have done. 

 This requires many hours of laboratory-based work and careful supervision from teachers to ensure that experiments are performed safely. 

 Paper 5 will consist of two questions each of 15 marks. 

 Question 1 will be a planning question, in which candidates will be required to design an experimental investigation of a given problem. The question will not be highly structured: candidates will be expected to answer with a diagram and an extended piece of writing. 

 Question 2 will be an analysis, conclusions and evaluation question, in which candidates will be given an equation and some experimental data. From these they will be required to find the value of a constant. This question will be structured but candidates will be expected to decide for themselves what they need to do in order to reach an answer. They will also be required to estimate the uncertainty in their answer. 

 Some questions on this paper may be set in areas of physics that are difficult to investigate experimentally in school laboratories, either because of the cost of equipment or because of restrictions on the availability of materials (e.g. radioactive materials). No question will require knowledge of theory or equipment that is beyond the syllabus. Candidates will be given the necessary information for questions set on topics that do not form part of the syllabus.

 For safety considerations, candidates should be able to: 

- assess the risks of their experiment 

- describe precautions that should be taken to keep risks to a minimum. 

 Candidates should be able to: 

- describe the use of an oscilloscope (or storage oscilloscope) to measure voltage, current, time and frequency

 Table of results Candidates should be able to: 

- complete a table of results following the conventions required for Paper 3 

- calculate other quantities from raw data and record them in a table 

- use the correct number of significant figures for calculated quantities following the conventions required for     Paper 3. 

 Where logarithms are required, units should be shown with the quantity whose logarithm is being taken, e.g. ln ( d / cm). The logarithm itself does not have a unit. 

 For logarithmic quantities, the number of decimal places should correspond to the number of significant figures. For example, if L / cm is 76.5 (3 sf), then lg ( L / cm) should be either 1.884 (3 dp) or 1.8837 (4 dp). 

 Graph Candidates should be able to: 

- plot a graph following the conventions required for Paper 3 

- show error bars, in both directions where appropriate, for each point on the graph 

- draw a straight line of best fit and a worst acceptable straight line through the points on the graph. 

 The worst acceptable line should be either the steepest possible line or the shallowest possible line that passes through the error bars of all the data points. It should be distinguished from the line of best fit either by being drawn as a broken line or by being clearly labelled. 

 Conclusion Candidates should be able to: 

- determine the gradient and _y_ -intercept of a straight-line graph 

- derive expressions that equate to the gradient or the _y-_ intercept of their straight lines of best fit 

- draw the required conclusions, with correct units and appropriate number of significant figures, from these     expressions. 

 Treatment of uncertainties Candidates should be able to: 

- convert absolute uncertainty estimates into fractional or percentage uncertainty estimates and vice versa 

- show uncertainty estimates, in absolute terms, beside every value in a table of results 

- calculate uncertainty estimates in derived quantities 

- estimate the absolute uncertainty in the gradient of a graph by recalling that     absolute uncertainty = gradient of line of best fit – gradient of worst acceptable line 

- estimate the absolute uncertainty in the _y_ -intercept of a graph by recalling that     absolute uncertainty = _y_ -intercept of line of best fit – _y_ -intercept of worst acceptable line 

- express a quantity as a value, an uncertainty estimate and a unit.

## 7 What else you need to know 

 This section is an overview of other information you need to know about this syllabus. It will help to share the administrative information with your exams officer so they know when you will need their support. Find more information about our administrative processes at http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 

### Before you start 

#### Previous study 

 We recommend that learners starting this course should have completed a course in Physics or Co-ordinated Science equivalent to Cambridge IGCSE™ or Cambridge O Level. 

#### Guided learning hours 

 We design Cambridge International AS & A Level syllabuses based on learners having about 180 guided learning hours for each Cambridge International AS Level and about 360 guided learning hours for a Cambridge International A Level. The number of hours a learner needs to achieve the qualification may vary according to local practice and their previous experience of the subject. 

#### Availability and timetables 

 All Cambridge schools are allocated to one of six administrative zones. Each zone has a specific timetable. 

 You can view the timetable for your administrative zone at http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/timetables 

 You can enter candidates in the June and November exam series. If your school is in India, you can also enter your candidates in the March exam series. 

 Check you are using the syllabus for the year the candidate is taking the exam. 

 Private candidates can enter for this syllabus. However, it is expected that private candidates learn in an environment where practical work is an integral part of the course. Candidates will not be able to perform well in this assessment or progress successfully to further study without this necessary and important aspect of science education. For more information, please refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries. 

#### Combining with other syllabuses 

 Candidates can take this syllabus alongside other Cambridge International syllabuses in a single exam series. The only exceptions are: 

- syllabuses with the same title at the same level. 

#### Group awards: Cambridge AICE 

 Cambridge AICE (Advanced International Certificate of Education) is a group award for Cambridge International AS & A Level. It allows schools to offer a broad and balanced curriculum by recognising the achievements of learners who pass examinations in a range of different subjects. 

 Learn more about Cambridge AICE at http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/aice

### Making entries 

 Exams officers are responsible for submitting entries to Cambridge International. We encourage them to work closely with you to make sure they enter the right number of candidates for the right combination of syllabus components. Entry option codes and instructions for submitting entries are in the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries. Your exams officer has a copy of this guide. 

#### Exam administration 

 To keep our exams secure, we produce question papers for different areas of the world, known as administrative zones. We allocate all Cambridge schools to one administrative zone determined by their location. Each zone has a specific timetable. Some of our syllabuses offer candidates different assessment options. An entry option code is used to identify the components the candidate will take relevant to the administrative zone and the available assessment options. 

#### Support for exams officers 

 We know how important exams officers are to the successful running of exams. We provide them with the support they need to make your entries on time. Your exams officer will find this support, and guidance for all other phases of the Cambridge Exams Cycle, at http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 

#### Retakes 

 Candidates can retake Cambridge International AS Level and Cambridge International A Level as many times as they want to. To confirm what entry options are available for this syllabus, refer to the Cambridge Guide to Making Entries for the relevant series. 

 Candidates can carry forward the result of their Cambridge International AS Level assessment from one series to complete the Cambridge International A Level in a following series, subject to the rules and time limits described in the Cambridge Handbook. 

#### Equality and inclusion 

 We have taken great care to avoid bias of any kind in the preparation of this syllabus and related assessment materials. In compliance with the UK Equality Act (2010) we have designed this qualification to avoid any direct and indirect discrimination. 

 The standard assessment arrangements may present unnecessary barriers for candidates with disabilities or learning difficulties. We can put arrangements in place for these candidates to enable them to access the assessments and receive recognition of their attainment. We do not agree access arrangements if they give candidates an unfair advantage over others or if they compromise the standards being assessed. 

 Candidates who cannot access the assessment of any component may be able to receive an award based on the parts of the assessment they have completed. 

 Information on access arrangements is in the Cambridge Handbook at http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/eoguide 

#### Language 

 This syllabus and the related assessment materials are available in English only.

### After the exam 

#### Grading and reporting 

 Grades A*, A, B, C, D or E indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge International A Level, with A* being the highest grade. 

 Grades a, b, c, d or e indicate the standard a candidate achieved at Cambridge International AS Level, with ‘a’ being the highest grade. 

 ‘Ungraded’ means that the candidate’s performance did not meet the standard required for the lowest grade (E or e). ‘Ungraded’ is reported on the statement of results but not on the certificate. In specific circumstances your candidates may see one of the following letters on their statement of results: 

- Q (pending) 

- X (no result) 

- Y (to be issued). 

 These letters do not appear on the certificate. 

 If a candidate takes a Cambridge International A Level and fails to achieve grade E or higher, a Cambridge International AS Level grade will be awarded if both of the following apply: 

- the components taken for the Cambridge International A Level by the candidate in that series included all the     components making up a Cambridge International AS Level 

- the candidate’s performance on the AS Level components was sufficient to merit the award of a Cambridge     International AS Level grade. 

 On the statement of results and certificates, Cambridge International AS & A Levels are shown as General Certificates of Education, GCE Advanced Subsidiary Level (GCE AS Level) and GCE Advanced Level (GCE A Level). 

#### ‘Cambridge International A Levels are the ‘gold standard’ qualification. They are based on 

#### rigorous, academic syllabuses that are accessible to students from a wide range of abilities yet 

#### have the capacity to stretch our most able.’

### How students, teachers and higher education can use the grades 

#### Cambridge International A Level 

 Assessment at Cambridge International A Level has two purposes: 

- to measure learning and achievement     The assessment: 

- confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in     the syllabus, to the levels described in the grade descriptions. 

- to show likely future success     The outcomes: 

- help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are     more likely to be successful 

- help students choose the most suitable course or career. 

#### Cambridge International AS Level 

 Assessment at Cambridge International AS Level has two purposes: 

- to measure learning and achievement     The assessment: 

- confirms achievement and performance in relation to the knowledge, understanding and skills specified in     the syllabus. 

- to show likely future success     The outcomes: 

- help predict which students are well prepared for a particular course or career and/or which students are     more likely to be successful 

- help students choose the most suitable course or career 

- help decide whether students part way through a Cambridge International A Level course are making     enough progress to continue 

- guide teaching and learning in the next stages of the Cambridge International A Level course. 

### Grade descriptions 

 Grade descriptions are provided to give an indication of the standards of achievement candidates awarded particular grades are likely to show. Weakness in one aspect of the examination may be balanced by a better performance in some other aspect. 

 Grade descriptions for Cambridge International A Level Physics will be published after the first assessment of the A Level in 2022. Find more information at http://www.cambridgeinternational.org/alevel

### Changes to this syllabus for 2022, 2023 and 2024 

 The syllabus has been updated. The latest version is version 2, published June 2020. The changes are indicated by vertical black lines. 

 The syllabus has been reviewed and revised for first examination in 2022. 

 You are strongly advised to read the whole syllabus before planning your teaching programme. 

 From 2022, the A Level components will assume knowledge of the revised AS Level content. All candidates should therefore be familiar with the AS Level content in this syllabus. 

 Changes to version 2, published June 2020 

 Changes to syllabus • The wording in learning outcome 3.1.6 and 4.1.1 has been updated. The meaning of these learning outcomes has not changed. 

- The list of command words has been updated on page 34. 

- The heading of 14.3 has been corrected to Specific Heat Capacity on page 24. 

 Changes to version 1, published September 2019 Changes to syllabus content 

- The learner attributes have been updated. 

- Small changes have been made to the key concepts to better reflect the     overarching ideas that run throughout physics. 

- The structure of the subject content has changed so that the AS Level and     A Level content is now split into separate sections. This makes the distinction     between the AS Level and A Level content clearer. 

- The wording in the learning outcomes has been updated to provide clarity     to what depth each topic should be taught. Although the wording will look     different in many places, the content to teach remains largely the same. 

- There has been a limited amount of change to topics: some topics have been     removed and others added, and some content has moved from AS Level to     A Level and vice versa; but the teaching time still falls within the     recommended guided learning hours. 

- Two topics ‘Communication’ and ‘Electronics’ have been removed from the     A Level. 

- A new topic ‘Astronomy and cosmology’ has been added to the A Level. 

- The AS Level content on electric fields has been moved to the A Level. 

- The sub-topics ‘NMRI’ and ‘Band theory’ have been removed from the     A Level. 

- The new sub-topics ‘PET scanning’ and ‘Discharging a capacitor’ have been     added to the A Level. 

- The new sub-topic ‘Polarisation’ has been added to the AS Level. 

- Content on ‘LDRs (light-dependent resistors)’ and ‘thermistors’ has been     moved from the A Level to the AS Level. 

- The topic ‘Measurement techniques’ is covered under practical skills. 

- The learning outcomes have been numbered, rather than listed by letters.

- The syllabus aims have been updated to improve the clarity of wording and     the consistency between AS & A Level Biology, Chemistry and Physics. 

- The wording of the assessment objectives (AOs) has been updated to     ensure consistency across AS & A Level Biology, Chemistry and Physics. The     assessment objectives still test the same knowledge and skills as previously. 

- The weightings of the AOs are now given as an approximate weighting.     Please see section 2 Syllabus overview for details. 

 In addition to reading the syllabus, you should refer to the updated specimen papers. The specimen papers will help your students become familiar with exam requirements and command words in questions. The specimen mark schemes explain how students should answer questions to meet the assessment objectives. 

 Any textbooks endorsed to support the syllabus for examination from 2022 are suitable for use with this syllabus.
