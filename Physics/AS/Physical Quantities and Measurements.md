### Physical Quantities and units

---

- Quantities that can be measured or calculated are called physical Quantities, Example length, force, energy etc.
- Non-Physical Quantities are those which cannot be measured. Example, joi, sorrow, happiness, sadness, sweet etc.

### SI Units

#### 7 Basic Physical Quantities

| Quantity                     | SI Base Unit |
| ---------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1. Length                    | meter(m)     |
| 2. Mass                      | kilogram(kg) |
| 3. Time                      | seconds (s)  |
| 4. Thermodynamic Temperature | Kelvin (K)   |
| 5. Electic Current           | Ampere (A)   |
| 6. Luminous Intensity        | Candela (cd) |
| 7. Amount of Substance       | Moles (mol)  |

#### Derived Quantities:


Any quantity made up of using one or more basic quantity is called a derived quantity and its unit is called a derived unit

e.g work (J), force (N), power(W), voltage (V)



#### Homogeneity:

When something is all same or the same kind.

- Units on either side of equation should be the same
- To check Homogenity of Physical Equations:
- - Check the units on both sides
  - Determine if they are equal
  - If not, The equation needs adjusting

| S.Form  | Prefix | Symbol |
| ------- | ------ | ------ |
| 10^12^  | tera   | T      |
| 10^9^   | giga   | G      |
| 10^6^   | mega   | M      |
| 10^3^   | kilo   | k      |
| 10^-1^  | deci   | d      |
| 10^-2^  | centi  | c      |
| 10^-3^  | milli  | m      |
| 10^-6^  | micro  | u      |
| 10^-9^  | nano   | n      |
| 10^-12^ | pico   | p      |

### Scalars and Vectors

---

**Scalar quantities** are those which only have magnitude and no direction, Distance, Time, Speed

**[Vector] quantities** are those which have both magnitude and direction, Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration, Force

#### Coplanar Vectors

- Coplanar - Vectors on same plane
	-  Use the parralellogram rule with Head to Tail rule, In order to find when to add or subtract vectors
	- ![](d7ebfa36b0e64c3e95fc87067aa8af16.png)

	- Equilibrium vectors with three forces make a closed tri - angle

### Errors

- The difference between the true value and the obtained value during an experiment

- **Systematic Errors:** Error caused by faulty equipment or flawed experiment design, These repeat and usually are caused by the same issue when repeated
	-  Effects :- Repeated with repeating the experiment, Can usually be avoided by by adding or substracting values in case of *Zero Error*
		- ![[Pasted image 20210927183809.png]]

- **Random Errors:** Errors caused by human errors and reaction times, these are variable and can differ from person to person. It can also be caused by natural variability; Temperature, Humidity, so on and so forth
	- Effects :- Variable with repeating the experiment, Can usually be reduced with repetition and optimizing/automatic human acted parts in the experiment
		- ![[Pasted image 20210927183758.png]]

- **Precision** is how repeatable a measurement is. An example is how close a second  arrow is to the first one (regardless of whether either is near the  mark).
	- *Precision* is how consistent results are when measurements are  repeated. Precise values differ from each other because of random error, which is a form of observational error. 
- **Accuracy** is how close a value is to its true value. An example is how close an arrow gets to the bull's-eye center. The **mean** is close to the actual value.

### Uncertainity:
**Absolute vs Relative Uncertainity**:
Absolute Uncertainity is the uncertainity in plain form like $3cm \stackrel{+}{-} 0.4cm$

**Relative Uncertainity** is *relative* to the original value $3cm \stackrel{+}{-} 13.33\%$
So; $\frac{0.4}{3} * 100$

```ad-note

##### Adding and Subtracting Uncertainities:
- **Absolute** uncertainties are added
$5cm \stackrel{+}{-} 0.4cm + 7cm \stackrel{+}{-} 0.2cm= \boxed{12cm \stackrel{+}{-} 0.6cm}$

##### Multiplying or Dividing Uncertainites:
- **Relative** uncertainties are added
$5cm \stackrel{+}{-} 8\% * 7cm \stackrel{+}{-} 2.84\%= \boxed{12cm \stackrel{+}{-} 10.85\%}$

##### Multiplying by a constant:
- **Relative** uncertainty stays same:
$3.4cm \stackrel{+}{-} 5.9\% *2 = \boxed{6.8 \stackrel{+}{-} 5.9\%}$

- **Absolute** uncertainty is also multiplied:
$(3.4±0.2 cm)×2=(3.4×2)±(0.2×2) cm=\boxed{6.8±0.4} cm$

##### Power of an Uncertainty:
- **Relative** Uncertainty is **Multiplied** with the power
$(5 cm±5\%)^2=(5^2±[2×5\%]) cm^2=\boxed{25 cm^2±10\%}$
$(10 m±3\%)^3=1,000 m^3±(3×3\%)=\boxed{1,000 m3±9\%}$

```

In order to calculate uncertainity use the formula: $\dfrac{uncertainity}{value(mean)}*100$
For multiple values (V and I to make an Uncertain R). Use the original formula for each (V, I) then add them together to get a net percentage uncertainity Then use the original values to get the answer with +- Uncertainity:
-	eg;
````ad-question

The resistance of a metal is given by R=V/I, where V is potential difference and I is the current. In a circuit, the potential difference across resistance is V=(8±0.5)V and current in resistance, I=(4±0.2)A˚. What is the value of resistance with its percentage error?
```ad-note
title:Answer
collapse:true

$(\dfrac{0.5}{8}+\dfrac{0.2}{4}) *100 = 11.25$%
$\dfrac{8}{4}=2\Omega \overset{+}{-}11.25$%
