 ## 3 Dynamics
 
 ### 3.1 Momentum and Newton’s laws of motion Candidates should be able to: 

 1. understand that mass is the property of an object that resists change in motion 
 
 2. recall F = ma and solve problems using it, understanding that acceleration and resultant force are always in the same direction 
 
 3. define and use linear momentum as the product of mass and velocity 

4. define and use force as rate of change of momentum 
 
 5. state and apply each of Newton’s laws of motion
 
 6. describe and use the concept of weight as the effect of a gravitational field on a mass and recall that the weight of an object is equal to the product of its mass and the acceleration of free fall 

 ### 3.2 Non-uniform motion Candidates should be able to: 

 1. show a qualitative understanding of frictional forces and viscous/drag forces including air resistance (no treatment of the coefficients of friction and viscosity is required, and a simple model of drag force increasing as speed increases is sufficient) 
 
 2. describe and explain qualitatively the motion of objects in a uniform gravitational field with air resistance 
 
 3. understand that objects moving against a resistive force may reach a terminal (constant) velocity 

 ### 3.3 Linear momentum and its conservation Candidates should be able to: 
 
 1. state the principle of conservation of momentum 

 2. apply the principle of conservation of momentum to solve simple problems, including elastic and inelastic interactions between objects in both one and two dimensions (knowledge of the concept of coefficient of restitution is not required)
 
 3. recall that, for a perfectly elastic collision, the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation
 
 4. understand that, while momentum of a system is always conserved in interactions between objects, some change in kinetic energy may take place

### Momentum:
```ad-tip
title:Definition
Momentum is the product of mass and it's velocity, A vector quantity
SI = $kg*m/s$
Formula = $p=mv$
```
- Mass is both a property of a physical body and the measurement of it's resistence to acceleration when a net force is applied, `Mass also determines the strength of its gravitational attraction to other bodies`
- F = ma, Where Resultant Force is parrallel to acceleration
	- Two objects colliding means $F21= -F12$
- Force is the Rate of change of momentum
	- $p=mv$, $\dfrac{F}{a}=m$ And Hence, $p = \dfrac{Fv}{a}$ If initial velocity was (u = 0), and so $t = \dfrac{v}{a}$
	- Final Formula, $F=\dfrac{p}{t}$

### Newtons Laws:
- 1st - An Object will stay at rest and an object will stay in motion unless a force acts on it aka Principle of inertia
	- A body will remain at rest or continue to move at constant velocity unless acted upon by a resultant force.
	- An object in rest, A feather in a vacuum tube falling at the acceleration of g

- 2nd -  Force is equal to the product of mass and acceleration, OR F is equal to rate of change of momentum
	- The rate of change of momentum of an object is directly proportional to the resultant force and takes place in the direction of the force.  
		- F=(mv-mu)/t or F=ma when m constant (at speeds like the speed of light, mass increases).
	- Calculation of g in $W = mg$

- 3rd - The third law states that all forces between two objects exist in equal magnitude and opposite direction
	- If body A exerts a force on body B, then body B exerts a force on body A that is equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and the same type of force (note - the forces act on different objects).
	- An object on a table?

### Non-uniform motion
When surfaces in contact move relative to each other, the friction between the two surfaces converts kinetic energy into thermal energy
**Fluid Friction**: Viscosity 
- **Dry Friction**: Kinetic Frictions or Static Friction, Resists relative motion of two object solid surfaces in contact
	-	They don't oppose the motion of the object but they oppose the direction of potential sliding between the two

- When a parashutist falls, His acceleration (g) with the product of his mass (m) causes a Force(F), Note that the velocity of the man is increasing (due to acceleration)
	- The Air resistence also causes a resitive force of kinetic friction and keeps on increasing until the Force between the two is equal
		- This will cause the RESULTANT force, To become zero. And hence the person will no longer accelerate **Terminal Velocity**

### Conservation
```ad-question
title:Definiton
In a closed system (one that does not exchange any matter with its surroundings and is not acted on by external forces) the total momentum remains constant

In physics, a conservation law states that a particular measurable property of an isolated physical system does not change as the system evolves over time.

```

```ad-question
title:Conservation Of Momentum
For a collision occurring between object 1 and object 2 in an isolated system, the total momentum of the two objects before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the two objects after the collision. That is, the momentum lost by object 1 is equal to the momentum gained by object 2.
```

```ad-question
title:Impulse
Impulse is a certain amount of force you apply for a certain amount time to cause a change in momentum
```


#### In-elastic Demonstration:
- [Demonstration](https://youtu.be/zaxqBAj0kKY)
	- Formula used: $m_1*v_1 = m_2 *v_2$


```ad-tip
Momentum is the same in a system! ALWAY remember that
$p_1=-p_2$
$F=-F$
$F*t = -F*t$
$m*v = -m*v$
```
