## Topic 12 (DC Circuits)

#### 12.1 (Practical Circuits)
![[Pasted image 20220313152456.png]]
- C
I increases when R decreases, Var Res must've decreased, So according to potentiodivider formula,
PD across r increased, PD across Var Res decreased

![[Pasted image 20220313152725.png]]
- C
Clearly it would divide to have the less resistant path more current, Method was simple; 
$\frac{1}{R} : \frac{1}{2R}$ 
$0.3/(ANS-in-sum) * 1 = 0.2$

![[Pasted image 20220313153103.png]]
- D
It asked that all switches are off, And ONLY two switches used to turn circuit on

![[Pasted image 20220313153230.png]]
- A
Volt in parallel Same, $4.1+3.7$ volts in one parallel
Same for the other so 
$2.2 + 1.2 + R = 4.1 + 3.7$

![[Pasted image 20220313153500.png]]
- B
Use power formula and test values for each resistor (100 100 in parallel) (100 in series)
$\frac{E^2}{150^2}*100$ and same for the 50ohm resistor (total of parallel)

- A 
Not in syllabus??

![[Pasted image 20220313153723.png]]
- D
Ratio of the two resistor paths must be same for voltage across their mid to be 0V

![[Pasted image 20220313154043.png]]
- C
When X dec, overall reistance dec, I2 dec MORE CURRENT GOES THROUGH X NOW, and so V1 increase as the parallel res is less!

![[Pasted image 20220313154305.png]]
- D
Current needs to be same, It same in series. So D

![[Pasted image 20220313154426.png]]
- A
C and B would make circuit break, No volt reading
D would change current
A remains and makes most sense

![[Pasted image 20220313154713.png]]
- A
B incorrect. It doesn't supply to an external circuit
C not necessarily, Int res can be present
D also not tru cuz of int res

![[Pasted image 20220313155002.png]]
- D
When connected to Y, The circuit should not function

**BETTER METHOD**
In case the middle voltage is zero:
![[Pasted image 20220312204359.png]]
Another one.
$\frac{50}{100} = \frac{R}{200}$
NOTE THE PATH OF VOLTAGE, THE FIRST ONE to get current are FIRST!

$15 = 2I_1 + 2I_2$
$9 = 2I_2 + 2I_3$
$I_2 = I_3 + I_1$

Increase in temp dec Res in thermistor
V increases

- B
DO some calcs

![[Pasted image 20220313162520.png]]
- B
If you know E2, you also know XT, E2/XT = PD/L

![[Pasted image 20220313163154.png]]
- C
DO CALCS AGAINNN
$I/(R_T) * R = A$
Decreasing, Increasing Resistance in other parallel has no affect on A!
