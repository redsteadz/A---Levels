## Kinematics


2.1 Equations of motion Candidates should be able to:

1. define and use distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration

2. use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration

3. determine displacement from the area under a velocity–time graph

4. determine velocity using the gradient of a displacement–time graph

5. determine acceleration using the gradient of a velocity–time graph

6. derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line

7. solve problems using equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance 

8. describe an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall using a falling object 

9. describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction

Distance:

- Is the total space covered by an object from points without any regards to direction

Displacement:

- Is the numerical space between to space with a specific direction, usually it's the shortest distance between two points!

Speed:

- Speed is the distance covered in one unit second.

Velocity:

- Is the displacement covered in one unit second in one direction

Acceleration:

- Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, Change in magnitude or direction.

#### Uniform Acceleration:

- Uniform acceleration means <u>constant</u> change in **velocity**.
- $$ y = mx + c $$
- - Where m stands for Acceleration ! Not changing (A straight line)
  - - $$ m/a = \dfrac{v_2-v_1}{t_2-t_1} \\ m/a = \dfrac{\Delta v}{\Delta t } $$
- Eq 1:
- - $$ v = u + at $$
- Eq 2:
- - $$ s = \dfrac{1}{2} * base/(u+v) * t $$
- Eq 3
- - $$ s = ut + \dfrac{1}{2}at^2 $$ 
- Eq 4:
- - $$ v^2 = u^2 + 2as $$
- - - Derived from Eq 1 and Eq

- Remember that when it says the total time spent in air, It means going up & coming down. So if you calculated the going up time as 1s then the total time in air would be  2*1=2s
- Note that velocity can be taken as negative when calculated average velocity
