 ## 12 Motion in a circle 

 ### 12.1 Kinematics of uniform circular motion 
 1. define the radian and express angular displacement in radians 
 2.  understand and use the concept of angular speed 
 3.  recall and use $ω = 2π / T$ and $v = rω$ 

 ### 12.2 Centripetal acceleration 
1. understand that a force of constant magnitude that is always perpendicular to the direction of motion causes centripetal acceleration 
2.  understand that centripetal acceleration causes circular motion with a constant angular speed 
3.  recall and use $a = rω^2$ and $a = v^2 / r$ 
4.  recall and use $F = mrω^2$ and $F = mv^2 / r$

___
The Circular motion of an object is measured in $\theta rad$  due to convenience

### Angular Displacement:
`ADD IMAGE`
Angular displacement is the **Angle Displaced** is the angle changed from an Object Moving; 
$$\Delta \theta_{f}- \Delta \theta_{i}$$
### Angular Velocity (Speed):
`ADD IMAGE`
Angular displacement is calculated in a similar way as velocity is, but You must understand the difference between Avg Vel and Instanteous Vel:

#### Average Velocity:
Is the mean velocity of the entire journey; 
$$
\frac{\Delta \theta_{f}- \Delta \theta_{i}}{\Delta t}
$$
#### Instaneous Velocity:
Will be the velocity for that exact instant
`image`

### Angular Acceleration:
$$
\begin{align}
 \omega =\frac{\Delta \theta_{f}- \Delta \theta_{i}}{\Delta t}  \\
 \alpha = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega_{f}- \omega_{i}}{\Delta t}
\end{align}
$$
- Getting Centripital Acceleration:
	- $$\begin{align*}
\alpha = \frac{R\Delta\omega}{\Delta t}\\
\alpha = v\Delta \omega\downarrow\\
&\alpha = r\omega^2\\
&\alpha = \frac{v^2}{r}
\end{align*}$$
