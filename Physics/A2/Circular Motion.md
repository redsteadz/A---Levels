 ## 12 Motion in a circle 

 ### 12.1 Kinematics of uniform circular motion 
 1. define the radian and express angular displacement in radians 
 2.  understand and use the concept of angular speed 
 3.  recall and use $ω = 2π / T$ and $v = rω$ 

 ### 12.2 Centripetal acceleration 
1. understand that a force of constant magnitude that is always perpendicular to the direction of motion causes centripetal acceleration 
2.  understand that centripetal acceleration causes circular motion with a constant angular speed 
3.  recall and use $a = rω^2$ and $a = v^2 / r$ 
4.  recall and use $F = mrω^2$ and $F = mv^2 / r$
