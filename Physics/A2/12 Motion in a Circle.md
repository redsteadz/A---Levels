 ## 12 Motion in a circle 

 ### 12.1 Kinematics of uniform circular motion 
 1. define the radian and express angular displacement in radians 
 2.  understand and use the concept of angular speed 
 3.  recall and use $ω = 2π / T$ and $v = rω$ 

 ### 12.2 Centripetal acceleration 
1. understand that a force of constant magnitude that is always perpendicular to the direction of motion causes centripetal acceleration 
2.  understand that centripetal acceleration causes circular motion with a constant angular speed 
3.  recall and use $a = rω^2$ and $a = v^2 / r$ 
4.  recall and use $F = mrω^2$ and $F = mv^2 / r$

### Measuring Circular Motion:
- **1 Radian**  is the angle of a sector when the arc length of that sector is equal to the radius of the circle
- ![[Physics/A2/attatchments/12 Motion in a Circle 2022-08-26 00.27.16.excalidraw.md#^area=RFr371tt]]
### **Angular Displacement ($\theta$)** 
- is the angle turned through by an object in any given direction in radians
### **Angular Speed ($\omega$)**
- is the rate of change of Angular displacement
- ![[Physics/A2/attatchments/12 Motion in a Circle 2022-08-26 00.39.14.excalidraw.md#^group=6CYJR1Y0]]
	- Angular to Linear: $v = \omega r$

### Centripetal Acceleration and Centripetal Force
- An Object in a circular path has a constant Speed but a changing Velocity
	- Direction Changing
- Therefore Acceleration must be present
	- For Acceleration, Force is needed $F=ma$
	- Object in need of a **Centripetal Force**
- ![[Physics/A2/attatchments/12 Motion in a Circle 2022-08-26 00.55.13.excalidraw.md#^area=IFJgexAT]]
**Centripetal Acceleration (a)**
- $$a=\frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r$$
	- V - the linear speed
	- r - radius
	- $\omega$ angular speed
- **Newtons Second Law** : F = ma we can derive Centripetal Force
	- $$F= \frac{mv^2}{r}= m \omega^2r$$
