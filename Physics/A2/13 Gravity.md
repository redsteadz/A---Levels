### 13.1:
- Gravitational Field is an example of a field of force (An area where a non contact force is applied)
- $$g = \frac{F}{m}$$
	- Gravitational Field can be defined as force per unit mass

There are two types of Force Fields
![[Physics/A2/attatchments/Gravity 2022-08-30 15.30.24.excalidraw]]
Gravity is a Non Uniform Field

### 13.2:
A point mass is the Point  at which the Mass is **equally** distributed around it of an Object
- An imaginery Point where the mass is "centered" to make calculations easier
  **Newtons Law Of Gravitation**
- Gravity Between two objects is directly proportional to the product of the mass of the two masses and inversely proportional to the the square of distance between the two objects point masses
- $$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
- Planets Orbitting other planets are due to this force, Centripetal and Centrifugal force is just a force that is allowing circular motion, Whether that be tension or, Here in this case **gravity**
![[Physics/A2/attatchments/Gravity 2022-08-30 16.08.53.excalidraw.md#^area=FItsYw6jAJLc01B7pvSuq]]
- The Moon has a centripetal force of ~$1.88 = 2*10^{20}$  

**Geostationary Objects** As the name implies, These objects are geologically in stationary position, Basically they orbit with the same velocity and In the same direction as the earth
- Hence remaining above the same point of Earth no matter what time
![[Physics/A2/attatchments/Gravity 2022-08-30 20.30.55.excalidraw]]

**Further Equation Derivation**

### 13.3 Gravitational Field of a Point Mass
- Relative to an incredibly large mass (earth), your Center of Radius and Mass is considered **insignifant**
- $$ 
\begin{align*}
m_em_o \approx M_{e}\\
(r_e+r_o) \approx R_e
\end{align*}
$$

Hence it can be used to get Gravitational strength

$$
\begin{align*}
F=\frac{GMm}{r^2}\\
 g  = \frac{F}{m} \\
F  = gm\\
g = \frac{GM}{r^2}

\end{align*}
$$
- This is the reason why for small changes in height from the earth still means *approx* the same g


### 13.4 Gravitational Potential
- The work done per unit mass in bringing a test mass from infinity to a defined point
$$
\phi = -\frac{GM}{r}
$$
If presumed, Infinity to be an infinitely, large value whilst 0 being nothing, Than r could be represented by
![[Physics/A2/attatchments/13 Gravity 2022-09-02 21.25.36.excalidraw.md#^area=CiRpClDqxcq7mNXSVoE75]]
**The Facts**
![[Physics/A2/attatchments/13 Gravity 2022-09-02 21.37.14.excalidraw.md#^area=SDIfukzhL1kcAtJRmKO_i]]
- g = 0, when r = $\infty$; 
- Attractive force, so as r decreases
	- **Positive** work done, when moving from r = $\infty$ to the point
		- Closer to the planet, its gravitational potential becomes smaller (More negative)
		- As mass moves away from planet, g.p becomes larger (more positive)
- **Basically, as g.p must *increase* to become 0, it's original value would be negative!** 
- ![[Physics/A2/attatchments/Meteor example.png]]
#### Gp to Gpe
$$\begin{align*}
G.P.E = \phi*m\\
G.P.E = -\frac{GMm}{r}
\end{align*}$$
Change in GPE can be shown as:
$$\Delta G.P.E = -\frac{GMm}{r_{2}} - (-\frac{GMm}{r_{1}})$$
$$\Delta G.P.E = GMm (\frac{1}{r_{1}} - \frac{1}{r_2})$$
