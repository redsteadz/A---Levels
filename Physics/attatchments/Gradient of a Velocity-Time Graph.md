### Gradient of a Velocity-Time Graph

- **Acceleration** is any change in the velocity of an object in a given time

- As velocity is a vector quantity, this means that if the speed of an object changes, or its direction changes, then it is accelerating 
  - An object that slows down tends to be described as ‘decelerating’
- The gradient of a velocity-time graph is equal to **acceleration**
