### Area under a Velocity-Time Graph

- Velocity-time graphs show the speed and direction of an object in motion over a specific period of **time**
- The area under a velocity-time graph is equal to the **displacement** of a moving object

displacement = area under a velocity-time graph

 title:Exam Tip

Always check the values given on the y-axis of a motion graph â€“ students often confuse displacement-time graphs and velocity-time graphs.

The  area under the graph can often be broken down into triangles, squares  and rectangles, so make sure you are comfortable with calculating area!
