***Apparatus used to measure g\***

#### Method

- When the current to the magnet switches off, the ball drops and the timer starts
- When the ball hits the trapdoor, the timer stops
- The reading on the timer indicates the time it takes for the ball to fall a distance, *h*
- This procedure is repeated several times for different values of *h*, in order to reduce random error
- The distance, *h*, can be measured using a metre rule as it would be preferable to use for distances between 20 cm – 1 m

#### Analysing data

- To find *g* , use the same steps as in the problem solving section
- The known quantities are
  - Displacement *s = h*
  - Time taken = *t*
  - Initial velocity *u* = 0
  - Acceleration *a = g*
- The equation that links these quantities is
  - s = ut + ½ at2
  - h = ½ gt2
- Using this equation, deduce *g* from the gradient of the graph of *h* against *t2*

#### Sources of error

- **Systematic error**:residue magnetism after the electromagnet is switched off may cause the time to be recorded as longer than it should be
- **Random error**: large uncertainty in distance from using a metre rule with a precision of 1mm, or from parallax error
