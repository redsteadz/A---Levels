### Projectile Motion

- The trajectory of an object undergoing projectile motion consists of a vertical component and a horizontal component
  - These need to be evaluated separately

- Some key terms to know, and how to calculate them, are:

  - **Time of flight:** how long the projectile is in the air
  - **Maximum height attained:** the height at which the projectile is momentarily at rest
  - **Range:** the horizontal distance travelled by the projectile

***How to find the time of flight, maximum height and range\***

- **Remember:** the only force acting on the projectile, after it has been released, is **gravity**
- There are three possible scenarios for projectile motion:
  - **Vertical** projection
  - **Horizontal** projection
  - **Projection** at an **angle**
- Let’s consider each in turn:

#### To calculate vertical projection(free fall)

A science museum designed an experiment to show the fall of a feather in a vertical glass vacuum tube.

The time of fall from rest is 0.5 s.

title:Exam Tip

Make sure you don’t make these common mistakes:

- Forgetting that deceleration is negative as the object rises
- Confusing the direction of sin θ and cos θ
- Not converting units (mm, cm, km etc.) to metres
