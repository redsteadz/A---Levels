### Defining Displacement, Velocity & Acceleration 

#### Scalar quantities

- Remember scalar quantities only have a magnitude (size)
  - **Distance:** the total length between two points
  - **Speed:** the total distance travelled per unit of time

#### Vector quantities

- Remember vector quantities have both magnitude and direction
  - **Displacement:** the distance of an object from a fixed point in a specified direction
  - **Velocity:** the rate of change of displacement of an object
  - **Acceleration:** the rate of change of velocity of an object
