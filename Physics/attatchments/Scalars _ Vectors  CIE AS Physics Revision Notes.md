### What are Scalar & Vector Quantities?

-   A **scalar** is a quantity which **only** has a magnitude (size)
-   A **vector** is a quantity which has **both** a magnitude and a direction
-   For example, if a person goes on a hike in the woods to a location which is a couple of miles from their starting point
    -   As the crow flies, their **displacement** will only be a few miles but the **distance** they walked will be much longer

**_Displacement is a vector while distance is a scalar quantity  
_**

-   **Distance** is a scalar quantity because it describes how an object has travelled overall, but not the direction it has travelled in
-   **Displacement** is a vector quantity because it describes how far an object is from where it started and in what direction
-   There are a number of common scalar and vector quantities

#### Exam Tip

Do you have trouble figuring out if a quantity is a vector or a scalar? Just think – can this quantity have a minus sign? For example – can you have negative energy? No. Can you have negative displacement? Yes!

### Combining Vectors

-   **Vectors** are represented by an arrow
    -   The arrowhead indicates the **direction** of the vector
    -   The length of the arrow represents the **magnitude**
-   Vectors can be combined by **adding** or **subtracting** them from each other
-   There are two methods that can be used to combine vectors: the **triangle method** and the **parallelogram method**
-   To combine vectors using the triangle method:
    -   **Step 1:** link the vectors head-to-tail
    -   **Step 2:** the resultant vector is formed by connecting the tail of the first vector to the head of the second vector
-   To combine vectors using the parallelogram method:
    -   **Step 1:** link the vectors tail-to-tail
    -   **Step 2:** complete the resulting parallelogram
    -   **Step 3:** the resultant vector is the diagonal of the parallelogram
-   When two or more vectors are added together (or one is subtracted from the other), a single vector is formed and is known as the **resultant** vector

#### Condition for Equilibrium

-   Coplanar forces can be represented by vector triangles
-   In equilibrium, these are **closed** vector triangles. The vectors, when joined together, form a closed path

**_If three forces acting on an object are in equilibrium; they form a closed triangle_**

### Resolving Vectors

-   Two vectors can be represented by a single **resultant vector** that has the same effect
-   A single resultant vector can be resolved and represented by **two** vectors, which in combination have the same effect as the original one
-   When a single resultant vector is broken down into its **parts**, those **parts** are called components
-   For example, a force vector of magnitude _F_ and an angle of _θ_ to the horizontal is shown below

-   It is possible to **resolve** this vector into its **horizontal** and **vertical** components using trigonometry

-   For the **horizontal** **component**, _Fx_ = _F_cos_θ_
-   For the **vertical** **component**, _Fy_ = _F_sin_θ_
