### Gradient of a Displacement-Time Graph

- Displacement-time graphs show the changing position of an object in motion

- They also show whether an object is moving forwards (positive displacement) or backwards (negative displacement)

  - A negative gradient = a negative velocity (the object is moving backwards)

- The gradient (slope) of a displacement-time graph is equal to 

  velocity 

  - The greater the slope, the greater the velocity

Don’t forget that velocity is a vector  quantity; it has a size and a direction. If velocity is initially  positive and then becomes negative, then the object has changed  direction.
