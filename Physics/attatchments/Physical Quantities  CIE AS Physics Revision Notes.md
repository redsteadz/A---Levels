### What is a Physical Quantity?

-   Speed and velocity are examples of physical quantities; both can be measured
-   All physical quantities consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit
-   In physics, every letter of the alphabet (and most of the Greek alphabet) is used to represent these physical quantities
-   These letters, without any context, are meaningless
-   To represent a physical quantity, it must contain both a numerical value and the **unit** in which it was measured
-   The letter _v_ be used to represent the physical quantities of velocity, volume or voltage
-   The units provide the context as to what _v_ refers to
    -   If _v_ represents velocity, the unit would be **m sâ€“1**
    -   If _v_ represents volume, the unit would be **m3**
    -   If _v_ represents voltage, the unit would be **V**

### Estimating Physical Quantities

-   There are important physical quantities to learn in physics
-   It is useful to know these physical quantities, they are particularly useful when making estimates
-   A few examples of useful quantities to memorise are given in the table below (this is by no means an exhaustive list)
