### Deriving Kinematic Equations of Motion

- The kinematic equations of motion are a set of four equations which can describe any object moving with **constant** acceleration
- They relate the five variables:
  - *s* = **displacement**
  - *u* = **initial velocity**
  - *v* = **final velocity**
  - *a* = **acceleration**
  - *t* = **time interval**
- It’s important to know where these equations come from and how they are derived:
