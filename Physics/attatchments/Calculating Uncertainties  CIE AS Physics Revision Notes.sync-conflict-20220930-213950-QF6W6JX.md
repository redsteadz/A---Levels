### Calculating Uncertainty

-   There is always a degree of uncertainty when measurements are taken; the uncertainty can be thought of as the difference between the **actual** reading taken (caused by the equipment or techniques used) and the **true** **value**
-   Uncertainties are not the same as errors
    -   Errors can be thought of as issues with equipment or methodology that cause a reading to be different from the true value
    -   The uncertainty is a range of values around a measurement within which the true value is expected to lie, and is an **estimate**
-   For example, if the true value of the mass of a box is 950 g, but a systematic error with a balance gives an actual reading of 952 g, the uncertainty is ±2 g
-   These uncertainties can be represented in a number of ways:
    -   **Absolute Uncertainty:** where uncertainty is given as a fixed quantity
    -   **Fractional Uncertainty:** where uncertainty is given as a fraction of the measurement
    -   **Percentage Uncertainty:** where uncertainty is given as a percentage of the measurement

-   To find uncertainties in different situations:
-   **The uncertainty in a reading:** ± half the smallest division
-   **The uncertainty in a measurement:** at least ±1 smallest division
-   **The uncertainty in repeated data:** half the range i.e. ± ½ (largest – smallest value)
-   **The uncertainty in digital readings:** ± the last significant digit unless otherwise quoted

**_How to calculate absolute, fractional and percentage uncertainty_**

#### Combining Uncertainties

-   The rules to follow
-   Adding / subtracting data – add the absolute uncertainties

-   Multiplying / dividing data – add the percentage uncertainties

-   Raising to a power – multiply the uncertainty by the power
