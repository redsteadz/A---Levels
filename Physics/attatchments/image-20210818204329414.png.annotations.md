define and use distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration
use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration
determine displacement from the area under a velocity-time graph
determine velocity using the gradient of a displacement-time graph
determine acceleration using the gradient of a velocity-time graph
derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, equations that represent uniformly accelerated
motion in a straight line
solve problems using equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including
the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance
describe an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall using a falling object
describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a
perpendicular direction
