### Motion Graphs

- Three types of graph that can represent motion are **displacement-time** graphs, **velocity-time** graphs and **acceleration-time** graphs

- On a 

  displacement-time graph…

  - **slope** equals **velocity**
  - the **y-intercept** equals the **initial displacement**
  - a **straight** line represents a **constant** velocity
  - a **curved** line represents an **acceleration**
  - a **positive** **slope** represents motion in the **positive** **direction**
  - a **negative** **slope** represents motion in the **negative** **direction**
  - a **zero** slope (horizontal line) represents a state of **rest**
  - the area under the curve is meaningless

- On a 

  velocity-time graph…

  - **slope** equals **acceleration**
  - the **y-intercept** equals the **initial velocity**
  - a **straight** line represents **uniform** acceleration
  - a **curved** line represents **non-uniform acceleration**
  - a **positive** slope represents an **increase** in **velocity** in the **positive** **direction**
  - a **negative** slope represents an **increase** in **velocity** in the **negative** **direction**
  - a **zero** slope (horizontal line) represents motion with **constant** **velocity**
  - the **area** under the curve equals the **change** in **displacement**

- On an 

  acceleration-time graph…

  - slope is meaningless
  - the y-intercept equals the initial acceleration
  - a zero slope (horizontal line) represents an object undergoing constant acceleration
  - the area under the curve equals the change in velocity
