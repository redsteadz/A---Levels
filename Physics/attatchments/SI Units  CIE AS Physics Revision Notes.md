### SI Base Quantities

-   There are a seemingly endless number of units in Physics
-   These can all be reduced to six base units from which every other unit can be derived
-   These seven units are referred to as the SI Base Units; this is the only system of measurement that is officially used in almost every country around the world

#### Exam Tip

You will only be required to use the first five SI base units in this course, so make sure you know them!

### Derived Units

-   Derived units are derived from the seven SI Base units
-   The base units of physical quantities such as:
    -   Newtons, **N**
    -   Joules, **J**
    -   Pascals, **Pa,** can be deduced
-   To deduce the base units, it is necessary to use the definition of the quantity
-   The Newton (N), the unit of force, is defined by the equation:
    -   Force = mass × acceleration
    -   N = kg × m s–2 = kg m s–2
    -   Therefore, the Newton (N) in SI base units is **kg m s–2**
-   The Joule (J), the unit of energy, is defined by the equation:
    -   Energy = ½ × mass × velocity2
    -   J = kg × (m s–1)2 = kg m2 s–2
    -   Therefore, the Joule (J) in SI base units is **kg m2 s–2**
-   The Pascal (Pa), the unit of pressure, is defined by the equation:
    -   Pressure = force ÷ area
    -   Pa = N ÷ m2 = (kg m s–2) ÷ m2 = kg m–1 s–2
    -   Therefore, the Pascal (Pa) in SI base units is **kg m–1 s–2**
