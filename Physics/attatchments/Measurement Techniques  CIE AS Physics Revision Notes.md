### Measurement Techniques

-   Common instruments used in Physics are:
    -   Metre rules – to measure distance and length
    -   Balances – to measure mass
    -   Protractors – to measure angles
    -   Stopwatches – to measure time
    -   Ammeters – to measure current
    -   Voltmeters – to measure potential difference
-   More complicated instruments such as the micrometer screw gauge and Vernier calipers can be used to more accurately measure length

-   When using measuring instruments like these you need to ensure that you are fully aware of what each division on a scale represents
    -   This is known as the **resolution**
-   The resolution is the smallest change in the physical quantity being measured that results in a change in the reading given by the measuring instrument
-   The smaller the change that can be measured by the instrument, the greater the degree of resolution
-   For example, a standard mercury thermometer has a resolution of 1°C whereas a typical digital thermometer will have a resolution of 0.1°C
    -   The digital thermometer has a higher resolution than the mercury thermometer

#### Micrometer Screw Gauge

-   A micrometer, or a micrometer screw gauge, is a tool used for measuring small widths, thicknesses or diameters
    -   For example, the diameter of a copper wire
-   It has a resolution of **0.01 mm**
-   The micrometer is made up of two scales:
    -   The main scale – this is on the sleeve (sometimes called the barrel)
    -   The thimble scale – this is a rotating scale on the thimble

-   The spindle and anvil are closed around the object being measured by rotating the ratchet
    -   This should be tight enough so the object does not fall out but not so tight that is deformed
    -   **Never** tighten the spindle using the **barrel**, only using the **ratchet**. This will reduce the chances of overtightening and zero errors
-   The value measured from the micrometer is read where the thimble scale aligns with the main scale
    -   This should always be recorded to 2 decimal places (eg. 1.40 mm not just 1.4 mm)

#### Vernier Calipers

-   Vernier calipers are another distance measuring tool that uses a sliding vernier scale
    -   They can also be used to measure diameters and thicknesses, just like the micrometer
    -   However, they can also measure the length of small objects such as a screw or the depth of a hole
-   Vernier calipers generally have a resolution of **0.1 mm**, however, some are as small as 0.02 mm – 0.05 mm
-   The calipers are made up of two scales:
    -   The main scale
    -   The vernier scale
-   The two upper or lower jaws are clamped around the object
    -   The sliding vernier scale will follow this and can be held in place using the locking screw
-   The value measured from the caliper is read when the vernier scale aligns with the main scale
    -   This should always be recorded to at least 1 decimal place (eg. 12.1 mm not just 12 mm)
