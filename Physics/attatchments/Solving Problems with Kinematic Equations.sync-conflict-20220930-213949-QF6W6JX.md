### Solving Problems with Kinematic Equations

- **Step 1**:

   Write out the variables that are given in  the question, both known and unknown, and use the context of the  question to deduce any quantities that aren’t explicitly given

  - e.g. for vertical motion *a* = ± 9.81 m s–2, an object which starts or finishes at rest will have *u* = 0 or *v* = 0

- **Step 2**:

   Choose the equation which contains the quantities you have listed

  - e.g. the equation that links *s, u, a* and *t* is s = ut + ½at2

- **Step 3:** Convert any units to SI units and then  insert the quantities into the equation and rearrange algebraically to  determine the answer

The diagram shows an arrangement to stop trains that are travelling too fast.

Trains coming from the left travel at a speed of 50 ms-1.  At marker 1, the driver must apply the brakes so that the train  decelerates uniformly in order to pass marker 2 at no more than 10 ms-1.

The train carries a detector that notes the times when the train  passes each marker and will apply an emergency brake if the time between passing marker 1 and marker 2 is less than 20 s.

How far from marker 2 should marker 1 be placed?

title:Exam Tip

- This is arguably the most important section of this topic, you can  always be sure there will be one, or more, questions in the exam about  solving problems with the kinematic equations
- The best way to master this section is to practice as many questions as possible
