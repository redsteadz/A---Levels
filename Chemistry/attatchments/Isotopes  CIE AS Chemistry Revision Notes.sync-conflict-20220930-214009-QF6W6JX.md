### Isotopes: Basics

-   Isotopes are atoms of the **same** **element** that contain the same number of **protons** and electrons but a different number of **neutrons**
-   The symbol for an isotope is the **chemical** **symbol** (or **word**) followed by a **dash** and then the **mass** **number**
    -   Eg. carbon-12 and carbon-14 are isotopes of carbon containing 6 and 8 neutrons respectively

### Isotopes: Chemical & Physical Properties

-   Isotopes have **similar chemical properties** but **different physical properties**

#### Chemical properties

-   Isotopes of the same element display the **same chemical characteristics**
-   This is because they have the same number of electrons in their **outer** **shells**
-   Electrons take part in **chemical reactions** and therefore determine the **chemistry** of an atom

#### Physical properties

-   The only difference between isotopes is the number of **neutrons**
-   Since these are neutral subatomic particles, they only add **mass** to the atom
-   As a result of this, isotopes have different **physical properties** such as small differences in their **mass** and **density**
