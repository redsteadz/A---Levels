### Ionisation Energies: Trends

-   Ionisation energies show **periodicity** – a trend across a period of the Periodic Table
-   As could be expected from their electronic configuration, the group I metals have a relatively low ionisation energy, whereas the noble gases have very high ionisation energies
-   The size of the first ionisation energy is affected by four factors:
    -   **Size of the nuclear charge** &uarr; = IE1 &uarr;
        -   The nuclear charge increases with increasing atomic number, which means that there are greater **attractive** **forces** between the nucleus and electrons, so more energy is required to overcome these attractive forces when removing an electron
    -   **Distance of outer electrons from the nucleus** &uarr; = IE1 &darr;
        -   Electrons in shells that are further away from the nucleus are less attracted to the nucleus – the nuclear attraction is weaker – so the further the outer electron shell is from the nucleus, the **lower** the ionisation energy
    -   **Shielding effect of inner electrons** &uarr; = IE1 &darr;
        -   The **shielding effect** is when the electrons in full inner shells repel electrons in outer shells, preventing them from feeling the **full nuclear charge,** so the more shells an atom has, the greater the shielding effect, and the lower the ionisation energy
    -   **Spin-pair repulsion**
        -   Electrons in the same atomic orbital in a subshell repel each other more than electrons in different atomic orbitals which makes it easier to remove an electron (which is why the first ionization energy is always the lowest)
-   So, the **first** ionisation energy **increases** across a period and **decreases** down a group

**This trend is  similar for almost all periods :)**

#### Ionisation energy across a period

-   The ionisation energy over a period **increases** due to the following factors:
    -   Across a period the **nuclear charge increases**
    -   This causes the **atomic radius** of the atoms to **decrease**, as the outer shell is pulled closer to the nucleus, so the distance between the nucleus and the outer electrons **decreases**
    -   The **shielding** by inner shell electrons remain reasonably constant as electrons are being added to the same shell
    -   It becomes **harder to remove an electron** as you move across a period; **more energy** is needed
    -   So, the ionisation energy increases
-   There is a rapid **decrease** in ionisation energy between the **last** element in one period, and the **first** element in the next period because:
    -   There is increased **distance** between the nucleus and the outer electrons as you have added a new shell
    -   There is increased **shielding** by inner electrons because of the added shell
    -   These two factors outweigh the increased **nuclear** **charge**
-   There is a slight **decrease** in IE1 between **beryllium** and **boron** as the fifth electron in boron is in the 2p subshell, which is further away from the nucleus than the 2s subshell of beryllium
    -   **Beryllium** has a first ionisation energy of **900 kJ mol\-1** as its electron configuration is **1s2 2s2**
    -   **Boron** has a first ionisation energy of **800 kJ mol\-1** as its electron configuration is **1s2 2s2 2px1**
-   There is a slight **decrease** in IE1 between **nitrogen** and **oxygen** and **phosphorus** due to **spin-pair repulsion** in the 2px orbital of oxygen
    -   **Nitrogen** has a first ionisation energy of **1400 kJ mol\-1** as its electron configuration is 1s2 2s2 2px1 2py1 2pz1
    -   **Oxygen** has a first ionisation energy of **1310 kJ mol\-1** as its electron configuration is 1s2 2s2 **2px2** 2py1 2pz1

#### Ionisation energy down a group

-   The ionisation energy down a group **decreases** due to the following factors:
    -   The number of protons in the atom is increased, so the **nuclear charge** increases
    -   But, the atomic radius of the atoms increases as you are adding more shells of electrons, making the atoms bigger
    -   So, the **distance** between the nucleus and outer electron **increases** as you descend the group
    -   The **shielding** by inner shell electrons **increases** as there are more shells of electrons
    -   These factors outweigh the increased nuclear charge, meaning it becomes **easier to remove the outer electron** as you descend a group
    -   So, the ionisation energy decreases

#### Successive ionisation energies of an element

-   The **successive** ionisation energies of an element **increase**
-   This is because once you have removed the outer electron from an atom, you have formed a **positive ion**
-   Removing an electron from a positive ion is **more difficult** than from a neutral atom
-   As more electrons are removed, the **attractive forces increase** due to decreasing shielding and an increase in the proton to electron ratio
-   The increase in ionisation energy, however, is not constant and is dependent on the atom’s electronic configuration
-   Taking calcium as an example:

-   The **first** electron removed has a low IE1 as it is easily removed from the atom due to the spin-pair repulsion of the electrons in the 4s orbital
-   The **second** electron is more difficult to remove than the first electron as there is no **spin-pair repulsion**
-   The **third** electron is much more difficult to remove than the second one corresponding to the fact that the third electron is in a **principal quantum** shell which is closer to the nucleus (3p)
-   Removal of the **fourth** electron is more difficult as the orbital is no longer full, and there is less **spin-pair repulsion**

#### Exam Tip

It is easy to remove electrons from a full subshell as they undergo **spin-pair repulsion.**

It gets more difficult to remove electrons from **principal quantum shells** that get closer to the nucleus as there is less **shielding** and an increase in **attractive forces** between the electrons and nuclear charge.
