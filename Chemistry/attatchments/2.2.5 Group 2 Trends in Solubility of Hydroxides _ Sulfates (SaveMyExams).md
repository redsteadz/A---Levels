# 2.2.5 Group 2: Trends in Solubility of Hydroxides & Sulfates

### Trends in Solubility in Group 2 Hydroxides & Sulfates

#### Group 2 hydroxides

*   Going down the group, the solutions formed from the reaction of Group 2 oxides with water become more **alkaline**
*   When the oxides are dissolved in water, the following ionic reaction takes place:

**O<sup>2-</sup> (aq) + H<sub>2</sub>O(l) → 2OH<sup>–</sup> (aq)**

*   The higher the **concentration** of OH<sup>–</sup> ions formed, the more **alkaline** the solution
*   The **alkalinity** of the formed solution can therefore be explained by the **solubility** of the Group 2 **hydroxides**

**Solubility of the Group 2 hydroxides table**

*   The hydroxides dissolve in water as follows:

**X(OH)<sub>2</sub> (aq) → X(aq) + 2OH<sup>–</sup> (aq)  
**Where X is the Group 2 element

*   When the metal oxides react with water, a Group 2 hydroxide is formed
*   Going down the group, the **solubility** of these hydroxides **increases**
*   This means that the **concentration** of OH<sup>–</sup> ions **increases,** increasing the pH of the solution
*   As a result, going down the group, the **alkalinity** of the solution formed increases when Group 2 oxides react with water

**_Going down the group, the solubility of the hydroxides increases which means that the solutions formed from the reactions of the Group 2 metal oxides and water become more alkaline going down the group_**

#### Group 2 sulfates

*   The solubility of the Group 2 sulfates decreasing going down the group

**_Going down the group, the solubility of the sulfates decreases_**
