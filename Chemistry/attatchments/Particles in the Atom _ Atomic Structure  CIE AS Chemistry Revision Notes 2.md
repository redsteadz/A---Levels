### Structure of an Atom

-   All matter is composed of **atoms**, which are the smallest parts of an element that can take place in **chemical reactions**
-   Atoms are mostly made up of **empty** **space** around a very small, dense **nucleus** that contains **protons** and **neutrons**
-   The nucleus has an overall **positive** **charge**
    -   The protons have a positive charge and the neutrons have a neutral charge
-   **Negatively** **charged** electrons are found in orbitals in the empty space around the nucleus

### Subatomic Particles

-   The **protons**, **neutrons** and **electrons** that an atom is made up of are called **subatomic particles**
-   These subatomic particles are so small that it is not possible to measure their masses and charges using **conventional** **units** (such as grams or coulombs)
-   Instead, their masses and charges are compared to each other, and so are called **‘relative** **atomic** **masses’** and ‘**relative atomic charges**’
-   These are not actual charges and masses but charges and masses of particles relative to each other
    -   Protons and neutrons have a very similar mass, so each is assigned a relative mass of **1**
    -   Electrons are 1836 times smaller than a proton and neutron, and so their mass is often described as being negligible
-   The relative mass and charge of the subatomic particles are:

#### Exam Tip

You can see from the table how the **relative** **mass** of an electron is **almost negligible**

The **charge** of a single **electron** is -1.602 x 10\-19  coulombs, whereas the charge of a **proton** is +1.602 x 10\-19  coulombs. So, relative to each other, their charges are -1 and +1 respectively

### Atoms: Key Terms

-   The **atomic number** (or **proton number**) is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom and has the **symbol** **_Z_**
    -   The atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons present in a **neutral** atom of an element
    -   E.g. the atomic number of lithium is 3, meaning that a neutral lithium atom has 3 protons and therefore, also has 3 electrons
-   The **mass** **number** (or **nucleon** **number**) is the total number of **protons** + **neutrons** in the nucleus of an atom, and has the  **symbol _A_**
-   The number of **neutrons** can be calculated by:

**Number of neutrons = mass number – atomic number**

-   -   Protons and neutrons are also called **nucleons**, because they are found in the nucleus
