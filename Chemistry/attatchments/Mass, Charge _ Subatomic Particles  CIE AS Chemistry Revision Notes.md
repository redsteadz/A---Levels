### Mass & Charge Distribution

-   The mass of an atom is **concentrated** in the nucleus, because the nucleus contains the heaviest subatomic particles (the neutrons and protons)
    -   The mass of the electron is negligible
-   The nucleus is also **positively** **charged** due to the protons
-   Electrons orbit the nucleus of the atom, contributing very little to its overall mass, but creating a **‘cloud’** of negative charge
-   The **electrostatic** **attraction** between the **positive nucleus** and **negatively charged electrons** orbiting around it is what holds an atom together

**_The mass of the atom is concentrated in the positively charged nucleus which is attracted to the negatively charged electrons orbiting around it_**

### Behaviour of Subatomic Particles in an Electric Field

-   Protons, neutrons and electrons behave differently when they move at the same **velocity** in an **electric field**
-   When a beam of **electrons** is fired past the **electrically charged plates**, the electrons are deflected **very easily** **away** from the negative plate towards the **positive plate**
    -   This proves that the electrons are **negatively** **charged**; like charges repel each other
    -   It also shows that electrons have a **very small mass,** as they are easily deflected
-   A beam of **protons** is deflected **away** from the positive plate and towards the **negative plate**
    -   This proves that the proton is **positively charged**
    -   As protons are deflected less than electrons, this also shows that protons are **heavier** than electrons
-   A beam of neutrons is not deflected at all
    -   Which proves that the particle is **neutral** in character; it is not attracted to, or repelled by, the **negative** or **positive** plate

**_The lighter electrons undergo much more deflection than the protons_**
