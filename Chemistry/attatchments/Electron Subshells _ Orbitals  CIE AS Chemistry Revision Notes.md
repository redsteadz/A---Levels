### Electron Orbitals

-   Each shell can be divided further into **subshells, labelled s, p, d and f**
-   Each subshell can hold a specific number of orbitals:
    -   s subshell : 1 orbital
    -   p subshell : 3 orbitals labelled px, py and pz
    -   d subshell : 5 orbitals
    -   f subshell : 7 orbitals
-   Each orbital can hold a maximum number of 2 electrons so the maximum number of electrons in each subshell are as follows:
    -   s : 1 x 2 = total of 2 electrons
    -   p : 3 x 2 = total of 6 electrons
    -   d : 5 x 2 = total of 10 electrons
    -   f : 7 x 2 = total of 14 electrons
-   In the ground state, orbitals in the same subshell have the same energy and are said to be degenerate, so the energy of a px orbital is the same as a py orbital

### Subshells & Energy

-   The **principal quantum shells** increase in energy with increasing **principal quantum number**
    -   E.g. _n_ = 4 is higher in energy than _n_ = 2
-   The **subshells** increase in energy as follows: s ＜ p ＜ d ＜ f
    -   The only exception to these rules is the 3d orbital which has slightly higher energy than the 4s orbital
    -   Because of this, the 4s orbital is filled before the 3d orbital
-   All the orbitals in the **same** subshell have the same energy and are said to be **degenerate**
    -   E.g. px, py and pz are all equal in energy

### The s & p Orbitals

#### s orbitals

-   The s orbitals are **spherical** in shape
-   The **size** of the s orbitals increases with increasing shell number
    -   E.g. the s orbital of the **third** quantum shell (_n_ = 3) is bigger than the s orbital of the **first** quantum shell (_n_ = 1)

**_The s orbitals become larger with increasing principal quantum number_**

#### p orbitals

-   The p orbitals are **dumbbell-shaped**
-   Every shell has three p orbitals except for the first one (_n_ = 1)
-   The p orbitals occupy the x, y and z-axis and point at right angles to each other so are oriented **perpendicular** to one another
-   The lobes of the p orbitals become **larger** and **longer** with increasing shell number
