# 2.2.2 Reactions of Group 2 Oxides, Hydroxides & Carbonates

### Reactions of Group 2 Oxides, Hydroxides & Carbonates

#### Reactions of Group 2 oxides with water

*   All Group 2 oxides are **basic**, except for BeO which is **amphoteric** (it can act both as an acid and base)
*   Group 2 oxides react water to form **alkaline** solutions which get more **alkaline** going down the group

**Group 2 oxide reactions with water table**

*   Remember that:

**oxide + water → hydroxide**

And that calcium hydroxide is also called **limewater**

#### Reactions of Group 2 metals with acid

*   The Group 2 metals will react with dilute acids to form **colourless solutions of metal salts **
    *   For example, they will form colourless solutions of metal chlorides if reacted with hydrochloric acid
*   When metals react with an acid, the by-product of this reaction is hydrogen gas

*   When some of Group 2 metals react with sulfuric acid rather than hydrochloric, an insoluble sulfate forms
*   Going down the group, the Group 2 sulfates become less and less soluble
    *   Calcium sulfate is sparingly soluble, but strontium sulfate and barium sulfate are insoluble

#### Reactions of Group 2 oxides with acid

*   Group 2 sulfates also form when a Group 2 oxide is reacted with an acid
*   The **insoluble sulfates** form at the **surface** of the oxide, which means that the solid oxide beneath it can’t react with the acid
*   This can be prevented to an extent by using the oxide in **powder** form and **stirring**, in which case neutralisation can take place
*   Remember that:

**oxide + dilute hydrochloric acid → salt + water**

**oxide + dilute sulfuric acid → sulfate + water**

#### Reactions of group 2 hydroxides

*   The Group 2 metal hydroxides form **colourless solutions of metal chlorides** when they react with a dilute acid
*   The sulfates decrease in **solubility** going down the group (barium sulfate is an insoluble white precipitate)

**Group 2 hydroxide reactions with dilute acids table**

*   Remember that:

**hydroxide + dilute acid → salt + water**

**hydroxide + dilute sulfuric acid → sulfate + water**

#### Reactions of group 2 carbonates

*   All Group 2 carbonates (except for **BeCO<sub>3</sub>**) are **insoluble in water**
*   All Group 2 carbonates will form **soluble chloride salts,** water and carbon dioxide gas when reacted with dilute hydrochloric acid
*   The carbonates of Ca, Sr and Ba form as an **insoluble sulfate layer** on their solid carbonates which **stops** any further reaction after the initial bubbling (**effervescence) of carbon dioxide gas** is seen

**Group 2 carbonate reactions with dilute acids**

*   Remember that:

**carbonate + dilute hydrochloric acid → salt + water + carbon dioxide**

**carbonate + dilute sulfuric acid → sulfate + water + carbon dioxide**
