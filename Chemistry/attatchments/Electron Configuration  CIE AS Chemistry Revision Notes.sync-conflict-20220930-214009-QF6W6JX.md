### Electron Configurations: Basics

-   The **electron configuration** gives information about the number of electrons in each **shell, subshell** and **orbital** of an atom
-   The subshells are filled in order of increasing energy

**_The electron configuration shows the number of electrons occupying a subshell in a specific shell_**

### Electron Configurations: Explained

-   Electrons can be imagined as small **spinning charges** which rotate around their own axis in either a **clockwise** or **anticlockwise direction**
    -   The spin of the electron is represented by its direction

**_Electrons can spin either in a clockwise or anticlockwise direction around their own axis_**

-   Electrons with similar **spin** repel each other which is also called **spin-pair repulsion**
-   Electrons will therefore occupy separate orbitals in the same subshell to minimize this repulsion and have their **spin** in the same direction
    -   Eg. if there are three electrons in a **p subshell**, one electron will go into each px, py and pz orbital

_**Electron configuration: three electrons in a p subshell**_

-   Electrons are only paired when there are no more empty orbitals available within a subshell in which case the spins are the **opposite** spins to minimize repulsion
    -   Eg. if there are four electrons in a p subshell, one p orbital contains 2 electrons with opposite spin and two orbitals contain one electron only

_**Electron configuration: four electrons in a p subshell**_

-   The principal quantum number indicates the energy level of a particular shell but also indicates the energy of the electrons in that shell
    -   A 2p electron is in the second shell and therefore has an energy corresponding to _n_ \= 2
-   Even though there is repulsion between negatively charged electrons (**inter-electrons repulsion**), they occupy the same region of space in orbitals
-   This is because the energy required to jump to **successive** empty orbital is **greater** than the inter-electron repulsion
-   For this reason, they pair up and occupy the lower energy levels first

### Electron Box Notation

-   The **electron configuration** can also be represented using the **electrons in boxes** notation
-   Each box represents an **atomic orbital**
-   The boxes are arranged in order of **increasing** energy from lowest to highest
-   The electrons are represented by opposite arrows to show the **spin** of the electrons
    -   Eg. the box notation for titanium is shown below
    -   Note that since the 3d subshell cannot be either full or half full, the second 4s electron is not promoted to the 3d level and stays in the 4s orbital

_**The electrons in Titanium are arranged in their orbitals as shown. Electrons occupy the lowest energy levels first before filling those with higher energy**_

### Free Radicals

-   A **free radical** is a species with one or more **unpaired electron**
-   The unpaired electron in the free radical is shown as a **dot**
    -   Eg. a chlorine free radical has the electron configuration 1s22s22p63s23p5
    -   Two of the three p orbitals have paired electrons whereas one of them has an unpaired electron

**_One of the p orbitals has unpaired electrons in a chlorine radical_**

#### Exam Tip

Free radicals are formed when a molecule undergoes **homolytic fission** where the two electrons of a covalent bond are split evenly between the two atoms.
