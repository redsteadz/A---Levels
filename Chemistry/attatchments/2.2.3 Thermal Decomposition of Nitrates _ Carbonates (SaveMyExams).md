## CIE A Level Chemistry (9701) exams from 2022

### Revision Notes

# 2.2.3 Thermal Decomposition of Nitrates & Carbonates

### Group 2: Thermal Decomposition of Nitrates & Carbonates

*   **Thermal decomposition** is the breakdown of a compound into two or more different substances using **heat**

#### Thermal decomposition of carbonates

*   The Group 2 carbonates break down (**decompose**) when they are heated to form the **metal oxide** and give off **carbon dioxide gas**
*   The general equation for the decomposition of Group 2 carbonates is:

**The thermal decomposition of magnesium carbonate to form magnesium oxide and carbon dioxide gas**

*   Going **down** the group, more heat is needed to break down the carbonates

#### Thermal decomposition of nitrates

*   The Group 2 nitrates break **decomposed** when they are heated to form the **metal oxide,** **oxygen gas** and **nitrogen dioxide gas** (which is a brown toxic gas)
*   Since the formed nitrogen dioxide gas is toxic, the decomposition of nitrates is often carried out in a **fume cupboard**

**The diagram shows the thermal decomposition of magnesium nitrate to form magnesium oxide, oxygen gas and nitrogen dioxide gas**

*   The general equation for the decomposition of Group 2 nitrates is:

*   Going **down** the group, more heat is needed to break down the nitrates
    *   The smaller positive ions at the top of Group II will polarise the nitrate ions more than the larger ions at the bottom of the group
    *   The more polarised they are, the more likely they are to thermally decompose
