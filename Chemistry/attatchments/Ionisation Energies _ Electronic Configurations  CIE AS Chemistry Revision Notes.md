### Ionisation Energies: Explained

-   **Energy** is required to remove an outer shell electron as this involves breaking the **attractive** **forces** between the electron and the **positively** **charged** **nucleus**
-   There are several factors which affect the magnitude of the ionisation energy:
-   **Nuclear charge**
    -   Positive nuclear charge increases with increasing number of protons
    -   The greater the positive charge, the greater the attractive forces between the outer electron(s) and the nucleus
    -   More energy is required to overcome these forces so ionisation energy **increases** with increasing nuclear charge
-   **Shielding**
    -   Electrons **repel** each other and electrons occupying the inner shells repel electrons located in shells further outside the nucleus and prevent them from feeling the **full** **effect** of the nuclear charge
    -   The greater the shielding effect is, the weaker the attractive forces between the positive nucleus and the negatively charged electrons
    -   Less energy is required to overcome the weakened attractive forces so ionisation energy **decreases** with increasing shielding effects

**_Shielding makes it easier to remove the outermost electrons_**

-   **Atomic/ionic radius**
    -   The larger the radius, the greater the distance between the nucleus and the outer shell electron(s)
    -   Increasing distance **weakens** the strength of the attractive forces
    -   Larger atoms/ions also result in greater **shielding** due to the presence of more inner electrons
    -   Less energy is required to remove the outer shell electron(s) so ionisation energy **decreases** with increasing atomic/ionic radius
-   Spin-pair repulsion
    -   Spin pair repulsion occurs when the electron being removed is spin paired with another electron in the same orbital
    -   The proximity of the like charges of electrons in the orbital results in repulsion
    -   Less energy is required to remove one of the electrons so ionisation energy **decreases** when there is spin-pair repulsion

**_Summary of factors affecting ionisation energies of atoms_**

### Ionisation Energies: Electronic Configuration

-   **Successive** **ionisation** **data** can be used to:
    -   Predict or confirm the simple electronic configuration of elements
    -   Confirm the number of electrons in the outer shell of an element
    -   Deduce the Group an element belongs to in the Periodic Table
-   By analyzing where the large jumps appear and the number of electrons removed when these large jumps occur, the **electron configuration** of an atom can be determined
-   Na, Mg and Al will be used as examples to deduce the electronic configuration and positions of elements in the Periodic Table using their successive ionisation energies

#### Sodium

-   For sodium, there is a huge **jump** from the **first** to the **second** ionisation energy, indicating that it is much easier to remove the first electron than the second
-   Therefore, the first electron to be removed must be the last electron in the **valence** **shell** thus Na belongs to group I
-   The large jump corresponds to moving from the 3s to the full 2p subshell  
    Na       1s2 2s2 2p6 **3s1**

#### Magnesium

-   There is a huge increase from the **second** to the **third** ionisation energy, indicating that it is far easier to remove the first two electrons than the third
-   Therefore the **valence** **shell** must contain only two electrons indicating that magnesium belongs to group II
-   The large jump corresponds to moving from the 3s to the full 2p subshell  
    Mg       1s2 2s2 2p6 **3s2**

#### Aluminium

-   There is a huge increase from the **third** to the **fourth** ionisation energy, indicating that it is far easier to remove the first three electrons than the fourth
-   The 3p electron and 3s electrons are relatively easy to remove compared with the 2p electrons which are located closer to the nucleus and experience greater **nuclear** **charge**
-   This is due to **weakened** **shielding** **effects** through the loss of three electrons
-   The large jump corresponds to moving from the **third shell** to the **second shell  
    **Al         1s2 2s2 2p6 **3s2 3p1**

#### Exam Tip

Find the large jumps by subtracting the successive ionisation energies from each other to identify when an electron has been removed from a different subshell.
