**Answer**

**Answer 1:** Potassium has 19 electrons so the **full electronic configuration** is:

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s1

The 4s orbital is lower in energy than the 3d subshell and is therefore filled first

The nearest preceding noble gas to potassium is **argon** which accounts for 18 electrons so the **shorthand** **electron configuration** is:

\[Ar\] 4s1

**Answer 2:** Calcium has 20 electrons so the **full** **electronic** **configuration** is:

1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2

The 4s orbital is lower in energy than the 3d subshell and is therefore filled first

The **shorthand** version is \[Ar\] 4s2 since argon is the nearest preceding noble gas to calcium which accounts for 18 electrons

**Answer 3:** Gallium has 31 electrons so the **full** **electronic** **configuration** is:

 \[Ar\] 3d10 4s2 4p1

**Answer 4:** What this means is that if you ionise calcium and remove two of its outer electrons, the electronic configuration of the Ca2+ ion is identical to that of argon

**Ca2+** is 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6      

**Ar** is also 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6
