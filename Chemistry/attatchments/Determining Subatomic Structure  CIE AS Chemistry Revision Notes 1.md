### Determining the Subatomic Structure of Atoms & Ions

-   An atom is **neutral** and has no overall charge
-   Ions on the other hand are formed when atoms either **gain** or **lose** electrons, causing them to become **charged**
-   The number of **subatomic particles** in atoms and ions can be determined given their atomic (proton) number, mass (nucleon) number and charge

#### Protons

-   The atomic number of an atom and ion determines which element it is
-   Therefore, all atoms and ions of the **same element** have the same number of protons (atomic number) in the nucleus
    -   E.g. lithium has an atomic number of 3 (three protons) whereas beryllium has atomic number of 4 (4 protons)
-   The number of protons equals the **atomic (proton) number**
-   The number of protons of an **unknown** element can be calculated by using its mass number and number of neutrons:

**_Mass number = number of protons + number of neutrons_**

**_Number of protons = mass number – number of neutrons_**

#### Worked example: Determine the number of protons

**Answer**

-   **Answer 1:** The atomic number of a magnesium atom is 12 suggesting that the number of protons in the magnesium element is 12
    -   Therefore the number of protons in a **Mg2+ ion** is also 12
-   **Answer 2:** The atomic number of a carbon atom is 6 suggesting that a **carbon atom** has 6 protons in its nucleus
-   **Answer 3:** _Use the formula to calculate the number of protons_

**_Number of protons = mass number – number of neutrons_**

**_Number of protons = 63 – 34_**

**_Number of protons = 29_**

-   -   **Element X** is therefore copper

#### Electrons

-   An atom is **neutral** and therefore has the **same** number of **protons** and **electrons**
-   Ions have a different number of electrons to their atomic number depending on their charge
    -   A positively charged ion has **lost** electrons and therefore has **fewer** electrons than protons
    -   A negatively charged ion has **gained** electrons and therefore has **more** electrons than protons

#### Worked example: Determine the number of electrons

**Answer**

-   **Answer 1:** The atomic number of a magnesium atom is 12 suggesting that the number of protons in the **neutral** magnesium **atom** is 12
    -   However, the 2+ charge in Mg2+ ion suggests it has **lost** two electrons
    -   It only has 10 electrons left now
-   **Answer 2:** The atomic number of a carbon atom is 6 suggesting that the **neutral** carbon **atom** has 6 electrons orbiting around the nucleus
-   **Answer 3:** The number of protons of element **X** can be calculated by:

**_Number of protons = mass number – number of neutrons_**

**_Number of protons = 63 – 34_**

**_Number of protons = 29_**

-   -   The **neutral atom** of element **X**  therefore also has 29 electrons

#### Neutrons

-   The **mass** and **atomic** **numbers** can be used to find the number of **neutrons** in **ions** and **atoms:**

**_Number of neutrons = mass number (A) – number of protons (Z)_**

**Answer**

-   **Answer 1:** The atomic number of a magnesium atom is 12 and its mass number is 24

**_Number of neutrons = mass number (A) – number of protons (Z)_**

**_Number of neutrons = 24 – 12_**

**_Number of neutrons = 12_**

-   -   The **Mg2+ ion** has 12 neutrons in its nucleus
-   **Answer 2:** The atomic number of a carbon atom is 6 and its mass number is 12

**_Number of neutrons = mass number (A) – number of protons (Z)_**

**_Number of neutrons = 12 – 6_**

**_Number of neutrons = 6_**

-   -   The **carbon atom** has 6 neutrons in its nucleus
-   **Answer 3:** The atomic number of an element **X** atom is 29 and its mass number is 63

**_Number of neutrons = mass number (A) – number of protons (Z)_**

**_Number of neutrons = 63 – 29_**

**_Number of neutrons = 34_**

-   -   The **neutral atom** of element **X** has 34 neutrons in its nucleus
