### First Ionisation Energy

-   The **Ionisation** **Energy** (**IE**) of an element is the amount of energy required to remove **one mole** of electrons from **one mole** of gaseous atoms of an element to form **one mole** of gaseous ions
-   Ionisation energies are measured under **standard conditions** which are 298 K and 1 atm
-   The units of IE are **kilojoules** **per** **mole** (kJ mol\-1)
-   The **first ionisation energy** (IE1) is the energy required to remove **one mole of electrons** from one mole of atoms of an element to form one mole of 1+ ions
    -   E.g. the first ionisation energy of gaseous calcium:

$\ce{Ca(g) → Ca+(g) + e–}$ IE1 = +590 kJ mol\-1

### Ionisation Energies: Equations

-   The **second ionisation energy** (**IE2**) is the energy required to remove the second mole of electrons from each +1 ion in a mole of gaseous +1 ions, to form one mole of +2 ions
-   The **third ionisation energy** (**IE3**) is the energy required to remove the third mole of electrons from each +2 ion in a mole of gaseous +2 ions, to form one mole of +3 ions
-   And so on…
-   The electrons from an atom can be continued to be removed until only the **nucleus** is left
-   This sequence of ionisation energies is called **successive ionisation energies**

#### Exam Tip

Remember that equations to represent ionisation energies must have **gaseous** (g) state symbols for the **atoms** and **ions** but **not** for the electrons.

You will lose the mark in your exam if you do not include the state symbols, even if the question does not specify for you to include them.
