### Electron Shells: Basics

#### Shells

-   The arrangement of electrons in an atom is called the **electronic** **configuration**
-   Electrons are arranged around the nucleus in **principal energy levels** or **principal quantum shells**
-   **Principal quantum numbers** (**n**) are used to number the energy levels or quantum shells
    -   The **lower** the principal quantum number, the closer the shell is to the nucleus
    -   The **higher** the principal quantum number, the lesser the energy of the shell
-   Each principal quantum number has a **fixed** number of electrons it can hold
    -   n = 1 : up to 2 electrons
    -   n = 2 : up to 8 electrons
    -   n = 3 : up to 18 electrons
    -   n = 4 : up to 32 electrons

#### Subshells

-   The principal quantum shells are split into **subshells** which are given the letters **s**, **p** and **d**
    -   Elements with more than 57 electrons also have an **f** shell
    -   The energy of the electrons in the subshells increases in the order s < p < d
-   The order of subshells appear to overlap for the higher principal quantum shells as seen in the diagram below:

#### Orbitals

-   Subshells contain one or more **atomic orbitals**
-   Orbitals exist at **specific** energy levels and electrons can only be found at these specific levels, **not** in between them
    -   Each atomic orbital can be occupied by a maximum of two electrons
-   This means that the number of orbitals in each subshell is as follows:
    -   **s** : one orbital (1 x 2 = total of 2 electrons)
    -   **p** : three orbitals ( 3 x 2 = total of 6 electrons)
    -   **d** : five orbitals (5 x 2 = total of 10 electrons)
    -   **f** : seven orbitals (7 x 2 = total of 14 electrons)
-   The orbitals have specific 3-D shapes

-   Note that the shape of the d orbitals is **not** required at AS Level

#### Ground state

-   The **ground state** is the **most stable electronic configuration** of an atom which has the **lowest amount of energy**
-   This is achieved by filling the subshells of energy with the lowest energy first (1s)
-   The order of the subshells in terms of increasing energy does **not** follow a regular pattern at n= 3 and higher
