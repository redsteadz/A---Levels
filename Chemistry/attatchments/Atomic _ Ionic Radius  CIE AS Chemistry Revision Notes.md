### Atomic & Ionic Radius

#### Atomic radius

-   The **atomic** **radius** of an element is a measure of the size of an atom
-   It is **half** the distance between the two **nuclei** of two covalently bonded atoms of the same type

**_The atomic radius of a hydrogen atom is determined by halving the distance between the nuclei of two hydrogen atoms covalently bonded_**

-   Atomic radii show predictable patterns across the Periodic Table
    -   They generally **decrease** across each Period
    -   They generally **increase** down each Group
-   These trends can be explained by the **electron** **shell** **theory**
    -   Atomic radii decrease as you move across a Period as the atomic number increases (increased positive **nuclear** **charge**) but at the same time extra electrons are added to the same **principal** **quantum** **shell**
    -   The larger the nuclear charge, the greater the pull of the nuclei on the electrons which results in smaller atoms
    -   Atomic radii increase moving down a Group as there is an increased number of shells going down the Group
    -   The electrons in the **inner** **shells** repel the electrons in the **outermost shells**, **shielding** them from the positive nuclear charge
    -   This weakens the pull of the nuclei on the electrons resulting in larger atoms

**_Trends in the atomic radii across a period and down a group_**

-   The diagram shows that the atomic radius increases sharply between the **noble** **gas** at the end of each period and the **alkali** **metal** at the beginning of the next period
-   This is because the **alkali metals** at the beginning of the next period have **one** extra principal quantum shell
    -   This increases shielding of the outermost electrons and therefore increases the atomic radius

#### Ionic radius

-   The **ionic** **radius** of an element is a measure of the size of an ion
-   Ionic radii show predictable patterns
    -   Ionic radii **increase** with increasing **negative charge**
    -   Ionic radii **decrease** with increasing **positive charge**
-   These trends can also be explained by the **electron** **shell** **theory**
    -   Ions with **negative** charges are formed by atoms **accepting** extra electrons while the **nuclear** **charge** remains the same
    -   The **outermost** electrons are further away from the positively charged nucleus and are therefore held only **weakly** to the nucleus which increases the ionic radius
    -   The greater the negative charge, the larger the ionic radius
    -   **Positively** charged ions are formed by atoms **losing** electrons
    -   The **nuclear charge** remains the same but there are now fewer electrons which undergo a **greater electrostatic force of attraction** to the nucleus which decreases the ionic radius
    -   The greater the positive charger, the smaller the ionic radius
