### General Properties:
- Valence Shell electronic configuration is $ns^2$
- Common oxidation state number is +2 (fixed)
-  &uarr; Reactivity &darr; the Group
-  &darr; **Melting Point **  &darr; the Group 
	-  As electron gets further away from nucleus
	- This means that the attraction between nucleus and the bonding electrons &duarr; causing &darr; melting point
- Density generally increases down the group
- **$\ce{Be}$** Small size only two shells be has less tendency to make ionic bonds

- **Soluble Salt**:
	- Chlorides, Nitrates, Hydrogen Carbonates, Sulfites
- **Insoluble Salt**:
	- Carbonates, Sulfates - except ($\ce{MgSO4}$)
- **Hydroxides/Oxide**:
	- Solubility Increases down the group ($\ce{MgO -> BaO}$)&uarr; , Least to most
- **Metal Nitrates**:
	- $\ce{M(NO3)2}$
	- White Crystalline Solids at RTP
	- Soluble in water

### Group 2 and Oxygen, Water and Dilute HCl, H2SO4

#### Air ($\ce{O2/N2}$)
- Most G-2 metals have formed an Oxide coating which prevents their reaction from air to be lively
**Beyllium** - Silvery Sparkles?
**Magnesium**: White Flame - White Solid can React with $\ce{N2}$ if heated strongly - **Reason:** This is because when
**Calcium**: Reluctant to start burning. then bursts into Scarlet Red flame - White Solid
**Strontium**: // 	// Scarlet Red flame - White Solid <u>Peroxides forms $\ce{SrO2}$</u>
**Barium**: Apply Green Flame - White Solid <u>Peroxides forms $\ce{BaO2}$</u>
They all react reasonably similarly

Formation of Peroxides increases down the group:
- Strontium, Barium form peroxides
	- **Reason** The upper elements are able to **Polarize** the peroxide, because they have High Charge Densitry ($\frac{Charge}{Volume}$)
	
#### Water
- **RTP(COLD)**
	- $\ce{Mg}$: React slowly, Releasing slow bubbles of colorless gas, After few minutes a white suspension is seen at the bottom of the beaker $\boxed{\ce{Mg + H2O -> H2 + \boxed{\ce{MgO -> Mg(OH)2}} }}$
	- $\ce{Ca}$ Reacts fast, Bubbles of colorless gas, After few minutes milklike solution is formed $\boxed{\ce{Ca + H2O -> H2 + \boxed{\ce{CaO -> Ca(OH)2}} }}$
	- $\ce{Sr}$ Reacts vigorously, Fizzez/Bubbles of colorless gas, After few minutes Strontium dissolves colorless solution is formed $\boxed{\ce{Sr + H2O -> H2 + \boxed{\ce{SrO -> Sr(OH)2}} }}$
	- $\ce{Ba}$ Reacts vigorously, Fizzez/Bubbles of colorless gas, After few minutes Barium dissolves colorless solution is formed $\boxed{\ce{Ba + H2O -> H2 + \boxed{\ce{BaO -> Ba(OH)2}} }}$


- **Steam**
	- $\ce{Mg}$: React faster, fizzing bubbles of colorless gas, After few minutes a white solid is seen at the bottom of the beaker $\boxed{\ce{Mg + H2O -> H2 + MgO}}$

#### Sulfuric Acid $\ce{H2SO4}$ /Hydrochloric Acid $\ce{HCl}$
- **$\ce{HCl}$**
	- Normal Reaction, Bubbles/Fizzez - Colorless Solution form
- **$\ce{H2SO4}$**
	- **$\ce{Be/Mg}$**
		- Reaction is same as Hydrochloric acid
	- **$\ce{Ca/Sr/Ba}$**
		- These are insoluble sulfates so reaction is slowed down by the insoluble layer. Some hydrogen formed in case of Ca. White percipitate forms.
		- **Solubility Decreasing Down Group**

### Oxides/Hydroxides/Carbonates + Water/Sulfuric-Acid/Chloric-Acid

#### Oxides
All G-2 are bases, except for BeO which is amphoteric
```ad-note
collapse:true
These increase in solubility down the group so more $\ce{X(OH)2 -> X + 2OH^{{-1}}}$ forms and the solution gets more alakline down the group! 
```
- **Water**
	- Oxides react to form Hydroxides and Water $\ce{XO + H20 -> X(OH)2}$
	- Solubility Increases down the group - So more pH down the group
- **Acid**
	- **$\ce{HCl}$**
		- Forms Water and Soluble(colorless Solution) chloride $\ce{X(OH)2 + HCl -> XCl2 + H2O}$
	- **$\ce{H2SO4}$**
		- Similar Reaction as metal + sulfuric acid, Solubility decreases down the group this prevents the oxide from reacting as the insoluble sulfate forms above it. This can be prevented by mixing or using powdered oxide

#### Hydroxides
- **Acid**
	- **$\ce{HCl}$**
		- Forms Water and soluble(colorless Solution) chloride    $\ce{X(OH)2 + HCl -> XCl2 + H2O}$
	- **$\ce{H2SO4}$**
		- Similar Reaction as metal + sulfuric acid, **Solubility decreases down the group** this prevents the oxide from reacting as the insoluble sulfate forms above it. This can be prevented by mixing or using powdered oxide

#### Carbonates
- **Water**
	- All Carbonates are insoluble in water except for $\ce{BeCO3}$
- **Acid**
	- **$\ce{HCl}$**
		- Forms Water and soluble(colorless Solution) chloride    $\ce{XCO3 + HCl -> XCl2 + CO2 + H2O}$
	- **$\ce{H2SO4}$**
		- Similar Reaction as metal + sulfuric acid, **Solubility decreases down the group** this prevents the carbonate from reacting as the insoluble sulfate forms above it effervescence of carbon dioxide reduces. This can be prevented by mixing or using powdered oxide

### Thermal Decomposition

#### Carbonates ($\ce{CO3}$)
- The G2 Carbonates break down (decompose) when they are heated to form the metal oxide and give off carbon dioxide gas
- The general equation for decomposition of G2 is:
	- $\ce{XCO3(s) -> XO(s) + CO2(g)}$
	- **Going down the group more heat is needed to break down the carbonate**

#### Nitrates ($\ce{NO3}$)
- The Group 2 nitrates break decomposed when they are heated to form the **metal oxide, oxygen gas, nitrogen dioxide gas(toxic brown gas) **
- Since the formed nitrogen dioxide is toxic, the decompostion of nitrates is often carried out in a **fume cupboard**
- The general equation of decompostion of G2 is:
	- $\ce{2X(NO3)2(s) -> 2XO(s) + 4NO2(g) + O2(g)}$
	- **Going down the group more heat is needed to break down the carbonate**
	- This is a redox!
	- The more polarised they are the more likely they are to thermally decompose, (Tendency of polarisation decreases down the group as the size of atoms increase.)
