#### 1.2 Intensive and Extensive properties (**Maybe Out of Syllabus**)

Extensive Properties - `Depend on how much matter` :

- Mass
- - More matter means more mass and hence dependant
- Volume
- - More Volume means more space CONSUMED by the object, hence dependant on matter

Intensive Properties - `Which do not depend on matter`:

- Temperature
- - No matter how many matter is there, the temperature will always remain same. They will exchange energy till there is equilibrium
- Color
- - Color of matter stays same even if there is more or less of it
- Density
- - Density is the ratio of Mass and volume and since matter affects those equally, density of an object remains same cuz of the element used

#### 1.3 The sizes of Atoms and Molecules:

Compound:

- Molecules
- - Non metals bonding by sharing electrons
- Ions
- - Metals + non metals bonding by giving or losing electrons, They carry a charge



#### 1.4 The masses of atoms and molecules:

```ad-note
title:**Unified Atomic Mass:**
- Defined as one twelfth of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12
- It's 1/12 the mass of carbon-12, it has the value of $1.66.6*10^{{-23}}$

24g of Carbon has mole of 2, and Mg has mole of 1, so carbon contains half the amount MASS because each atom of Carbon has half the mass of Mg

Like this for example:

- Carbon has 12units of mass for ONE atom, and Mg has 24units of mass for one atom, Why?

- Protons and Neutrons. Carbon has half the amount of Nucleon number compared to Mg, so there needs to be twice the amount of Atoms present to have equal mass for the SAME amount of atoms present in Mg
 
```


````ad-note
title:Definition used with &uarr;
**Reletive atomic masses (Ar) or atomic weight**

is a dimensionless physical quantity defined as the ratio of the average mass of atoms of a chemical element in a given sample to the atomic  mass constant. The atomic mass constant is defined as being 1/12 of the  mass of a carbon-12 atom. Formula:

$$
Relative-atomic-mass-of-E =\dfrac{avaerage-mass-of-one-atom-of-E}{\dfrac{1}{12}the-mass-of-one-atom-of-C^{{12}}}$$

```ad-tip
title:Understanding the formula
Carbon 12 is approximately 12 times heavier then H.
Hence it can be used because carbon is used a lot in chemistry and was used instead of Hydrogen
```
  - Since this is RELATIVE atomic mass it's symbol is Ar and has no unit.

**Relative Isotopic Mass**:

- Is the atomic mass of an isotope relative to the unified atomic mass (1/12 of Carbon-12)


**Relative Molecular Mass/Formula Mass:**

- The relative molecular mass of a substance is equal to the sum of the relative atomic masses of all the elements making up the chemical compound
- - Molecular mass for **Molecules**
- - Formula Mass for **Ionics**
````


#### 1.5 Moles:

Mg with 24g has 1mole. 24/24

C-12 with 12g has 1mole. 12/12

- One mole is the amount that contains the same number of atoms as there are in 12g of Carbon-12
- It's called Molar Masss (M), Numerically equal to relative atomic mass. Ar
- Relative atomic mass of carbon = 12
- molar mass of carbon = 12gmol^-1^

**Avagadros constant:**

- Is the amount of atoms present in 1 mole of a 

  substance

- Emparical formula

- - The emparical formula is the simplest formula that shows the relative number of atoms of 

    each element present in a compound

- Molecular formula

- - The molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms of each element present in a molecule of the compound



#### 1.9 Equations:

Law of Conservation of Mass:

- Mass of Reactants = Mass of Products
- - Balanced Equations, No atoms made or destroyed!

Formulaes to take note of:

$\ce{NO_3~^-}$ 
$CO_3^{-2}$
$\ce{SO_4^{2-}}$
$\ce{OH^-}$
$\ce{NH_4^+}$
$\ce{Zn^2+}$
$\ce{Ag^+}$
$\ce{HCO_3^-}$
$\ce{PO_4^3-}$

**Anhydrous:**
- Not with water

**Hydrated:**
- With water

**Water of Crystallisation:**

- Water present in crystals
