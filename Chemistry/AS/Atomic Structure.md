### 1 Atomic structure
#### 1.1 Particles in the atom and atomic radius

1. understand that atoms are mostly empty space surrounding a very small, dense nucleus that containsprotons and neutrons; electrons are found in shells in the empty space around the nucleus

2. identify and describe protons, neutrons and electrons in terms of their relative charges and relative masses

3. understand the terms atomic and proton number; mass and nucleon number

4. describe the distribution of mass and charge within an atom

5. describe the behaviour of beams of protons, neutrons and electrons moving at the same velocity in an electric field

6. determine the numbers of protons, neutrons and electrons present in both atoms and ions given atomic or proton number, mass or nucleon number and charge

7. state and explain qualitatively the variations in atomic radius and ionic radius across a period and down a group

#### 1.2 Isotopes

1. define the term isotope in terms of numbers of protons and neutrons

2. understand the notation A for isotopes, where * is the mass or nucleon number andy is the atomic or proton number

3. state that and explain why isotopes of the same element have the same chemical properties

4. state that and explain why isotopes of the same element have different physical properties, limited to mass and density

#### 1.3 Electrons, energy levels and atomic orbitals
In 1.3 each atom or ion described will be in the ground state. Only the elements hydrogen to krypton will be assessed
1. understand the terms
	- shells, sub-shells and orbitals
	- principal quantum number (n)
	 - ground state, limited to electronic configuration
2. describe the number of orbitals making up s, pand d sub-shells, and the number of electrons that can fills, p and d sub-shells
3. describe the order of increasing energy of the sub-shells within the first three shells and the 4s and 4p sub-shells
4. describe the electronic configurations to include the number of electrons in each shell, sub-shell and orbital
5. explain the electronic configurations in terms of energy of the electrons and inter-electron repulsion
6. determine the electronic configuration of atoms and ions given the atomic or proton number and charge, using either of the following conventions:
e.g. for Fe: $\ce{1s^2, 2s^2, 2p^6, 3s^2, 3p^6, 3d^6, 4s^2} $   (full electronic configuration) or $\ce{[Ar], 3d^6 4s^2 }$  (shorthand electronic configuration)

7. understand and use the electrons in boxes notationeg. for Fe:

8. describe and sketch the shapes ofs and p orbitals
9. describe a free radical as a species with one or more unpaired electrons
#### 1.4 Ionisation energy
In 1.4 each atom or ion described will be in the ground state. Only the elements hydrogen to krypton will be assessed.
1. define and use the term first ionisation energy, IE
2. construct equations to represent first, second and subsequent ionisation energies
3. identify and explain the trends in ionisation energies across a period and down a group of the Periodic Table
4. identify and explain the variation in successive ionisation energies of an element
5. understand that ionisation energies are due to the attraction between the nucleus and the outer electron
6. explain the factors influencing the ionisation energies of elements in terms of nuclear charge, atomic/ionic radius, shielding by inner shells and sub-shells and spin-pair repulsion
7. deduce the electronic configurations of elements using successive ionisation energy data
8. deduce the position of an element in the Periodic Table using successive ionisation energy data

### Paricles in the Aton and atomic Radius:
---

- Behaviour of particles in an electric fields
  - Protons - Negative plate
  - Negative - Positive Plate
  - Would deflect more cuz less mass
  - Neutron - no where


- ** Atomic Number/Proton Number** :
>  Is the number of Protons in the nucleus 
-  **Mass Number/ Nucleon Number** :  
> The number of Protons + Neutrons or the mass of the atom
---

### Isotopes:

---


-  Subatomic particles
    - Atoms of the same element with the same amount of protons and different neutrons
    - Atoms of the same element with the same amount of protons and different neutrons
     - Similarities
       -  Symbol
        - Same Atomic no
        - Same proton no
        - Same no of shells
        - Same no of electrons
        - Same electronic config
        - Valency same
        - Similar chemical properties 
  - Differences
     -  Number of neutron
     - Nucleon number
     - Radioactive decay

### Energy in Shells:
- Every shell has a particular energy
- 7 shells - k l m n o p q
- Electrons are at different energy level  
	- The more energy level, less stable 
	- The less energy, more stable
- There are electrostatic forces between the positive nucleus and electrons
	- The electrons further away from the nucleus is least attracted by the nucleus
		- Can be removed easily because it has more potential energy
- Nuclear charge:
	- No of protons in nucleus
		- F>O>N
	- Outermost will participate
	- 3 layer atom - 3 Shells
- Sub shell - division of Shell
	- 4 types
		- s &rarr; 2 electrons max &rarr; Size &uarr;  = shell &uarr; - 1 sub orb ![s,p,d,f Orbitals - Chemistry | Socratic](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20121230104309/ellesmere-chemistry/images/thumb/5/54/S-orbitals_3-up.jpg/250px-S-orbitals_3-up.jpg)
		- p &rarr;  6 electrons max  &rarr; Each accomodate 2 electrons, 3 blocks 
			- p orbital ![Shapes of p-Orbitals](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/~ngreeves/ltfdemo/jmol/images/3porbitals.png)
		- d &rarr; 10 &rarr;  ( Diagram in A2), 5 blocks 
		- f &rarr; 14 &rarr; ( Diagram in Uni ), 7 blocks
- Orbitals
	- ```ad-note
		title: Definition
		collapse:closed
		Any region around the nucleus where the chances of finding an electron is maximum
		```
	- Shape of orbitals is path of electron
	- Chance of Electron on node is zero
	- An orbital can have maximum of 2 electrons
	- Shell &rarr; Sub shell &rarr; orbitals
- Rules for electronic configuration
	- The filling of electrons in the orbitals is called the electronic configuration
	- Electrons are filled according to Aufbau; 
		-   The Aufbau principle states **that electrons fill lower-energy atomic orbitals before filling higher-energy ones** 
			- ![](Pasted%20image%2020210902150609.png)
			- Further more the d orbital is MORE because it has lower energy stable Half filled, or fully filled because the 4s electron in 4s^2 state is less stable has more energy
- Quantum Numbers
	- Used to define position of electron inside one atom
	- 4 type
		- Principal - quantum Number (n)
			- Which shell can hold how many max electrons
			- 2n^2
		- Azmuthal Quantum Number (l)
			- Shape of subshell where spdf electrons reside l is a ranged function, if n = 3, then l can be 0,1,2 or (s, p, d)
			- l = n - 1
		- Magnetic Quantum Number (m)
			- Every subshell and every orbital as magnetic value
		- Spin Quantum Number (s)
			- Movement/direction of electrons
			- Clockwise = 1/2
			- Anticlockwise = -1/2
			- Parallel spin/spin free
				- s =  [&uarr; &darr;]
				- p = [&uarr; &darr;  | &uarr; &darr; | &uarr; &darr; ]
			- Opposite spin/spin paired
				- s = [&uarr; ]
				- p = [ &uarr; | &uarr; | &uarr; ]
- Electronic Configuration
	- Filling of Electrons in orbitals
	- Dome by following Aufbau principle
	- Number of shell = number of blocks ( spdf )
	- First 20
	- Second 21-30
	- Third Cation, Anion

## <center> ==Summary== </center>
- Spin Pair Repulsion is less stable then no spin pair repulsion/paired electrons
- If 1st I.E >=1500 &larr; G-0
- If 1st I.E extremely easy todo then G-1, and so on
-   Electron shielding refers to the blocking of valence shell electron attraction by the nucleus due to the presence of inner-shell electrons.
-   Electrons in an _s_ orbital can shield _p_ electrons at the same energy level because of the spherical shape of the _s_ orbital.
-   Electrons in paired spin configurations are slightly easier to remove than unpaired electrons.
