### Electronegativity & bonding
- Electronegativity is the power of an atom to attract electrons to itself
	- &uarr;Nuclear Charge = &uarr;E.N
	- &darr;Atomic Radii = &uarr;E.N
	- &darr;Shielding Effect = &uarr;E.N
- Increases down the Period (As nuclear Charge increase)
- Decreases down the Group (As ShieldingEffect&AtomicRadii increase)

The prediction of whether a compound is Ionic or Covelant is done by the difference in electronegativity, The more the difference the more ionic the bond is:
- $\Delta E.N$ = 0; Nonpolar Bond (Polarization is the ability to 'weaken' the other atom)
- $\Delta E.N$ >=1; Ionic Bond
- $\Delta E.N$ <=; Polar Covelant Bond (Partly Ionic)

-   No electronegativity difference between two atoms leads to a pure non-polar covalent bond.
-   A small electronegativity difference leads to a polar covalent bond.
-   A large electronegativity difference leads to an ionic bond.

Molecules can form non polar bonds when they are in opposite direction and are equal![[Pasted image 20211104223427.png]]
```ad-note
title:Spectrum of Bonds
collapse:true
The implication of all this is that there is no clear-cut division between covalent and ionic bonds. In a pure covalent bond, the electrons are held on average exactly half way between the atoms. In a polar bond, the electrons have been dragged slightly towards one end. How far does this dragging have to go before the bond counts as ionic? There is no real answer to that. Sodium chloride is typically considered an ionic solid, but even here the sodium has not completely lost control of its electron. Because of the properties of sodium chloride, however, we tend to count it as if it were purely ionic. Lithium iodide, on the other hand, would be described as being "ionic with some covalent character". In this case, the pair of electrons has not moved entirely over to the iodine end of the bond. Lithium iodide, for example, dissolves in organic solvents like ethanol - not something which ionic substances normally do.
```

### Ionic Bonding
Ionic Bonding is the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions (positively charged cations and negatively charged anions)

Ionic Bonding occurs when the less electronegative element bonds with the more electronegative element resulting in a polar covelant bond which has such a large difference in E.N that they no longer seem to be "sharing" electrons, Instead one atom has taken "complete" control of the electrons of the other atom, An example is $\ce{NaCl}$

### Metallic Bonding
Is the electrostatic attraction between positive metal ions and delocalised electrons

### Covelant Bonding
Is the electrostatic attraction between the nuclei of two atoms and a shared pair of electrons
- Dative/Co-ordinate Bonding 
	- Is when a Covelant bond is formed but only **ONE** atom provides the atoms
	- $\ce{NH3 + HCl -> NH4^+ + Cl^-}$
		- ![[Pasted image 20211104230929.png]]
		- The Electron deficient Hydrogen in the HCl left the molecule and went to bond (dative) with the NH3
	- $\ce{H2O + HCl -> H3O^+ + Cl^-}$
		- ![[Pasted image 20211104230651.png]]
		- $\ce{H^+(aq)}$ is actually a $\ce{H3O+}$ ion as Hydrogen ion is far too reactive to exist. Whenver this reacts. The Hydrogen just breaks the dative bond!
	- $\ce{AlCl3}$ &larr; $\ce{Al2Cl6}$
		- AlCl3 **sublimes** at a low temperature of 130C and this indicates that it was bonded covelantly, And Indeed it was! In this structure Aluminium has not yet fulled it's electron shell, It's electron deficient and so it fixes this by taking electrons from another molecule of AlCl3 and forms Al2Cl3
		- ![[Pasted image 20211104231859.png]]

#### Overlapping of Orbitals $\pi,\sigma$
When covalent bonds form, The atoms orbitals converge and "overlap" and hence the Valence Electron Theory can be used, By knowing the orbitals in which the bonding electrons reside. We can make the orbitals which would overlap
- This overlap occurs from the attraction of electrons to the nucleus, There is a repulsion of electrons but at one point. The attraction b/w nucleus and electrons & repulsion b/w electrons is at a stale mate where the energy is the least (Stable compound formed)

**Hybridization**: Is when the orbitals (Hybridize) to form hybrid orbitals for bonding. e.g Carbon with 4 bonds hybridizes it's $2s^2,2p^2$ to make $2sp^3$, The s2 orbital gives it's electron to the last p_z orbital and forms a bond. Visual Representation is like so
s & px, py, pz orbital:
![[Pasted image 20211107121939.png]]
$2sp^3$:
![[Pasted image 20211107122033.png]]
**Hybridized bonding ** like $\ce{CH4}$ where Hydrogens s orbital bond with these 4(2sp3's) like so where the red electron are contributions of Hydrogen, filling the  outershell:
![[Pasted image 20211107122321.png]]




- $\sigma$; Is when electron density resides between the two nucleus
	- s-s Orbital bonding ($\ce{H2}$)
		- ![[Pasted image 20211106232505.png]]
	- s-p Orbital bonding ($\ce{HCl}$)
		- ![[Pasted image 20211106232550.png]]
	- p-p Orbital bonding ($\ce{Cl2)$)
		- ![[Pasted image 20211106232650.png]]
- $\pi$; Is the type of bonding where the node is between the orbitals, both types of bonding can take place at the same time
	- ![[Pasted image 20211107141051.png]]
		- Single $\pi$ bond
		- ![[Pasted image 20211107141226.png]]
			- Double $\pi$ bond

Formation of bonds in molecules
-  $\ce{H2}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20211106232505.png]]
- $\ce{C2H6}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20211107133146.png]]
	- The carbon atoms orbitals hybridize and form 4x2sp3 orbitals and now has 4 places able to bond while hydrogen bonds with it's 1s1 orbital
- $\ce{C2H4}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20211107132442.png]]
	- In this bond Carbon makes 2sp2 Hybridized orbitals and hence leaving one p orbital out, These p orbitals in both Carbon atoms bond by $\pi$ bond!
- $\ce{HCN}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20211107133903.png]]
	- The Carbon in this bond make 2sp leaving 2p2 for the $\pi$ bonding, The Nitrogen makes
- $\ce{N2}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20211107140706.png]]
	- The 2 Nitrogens form 2sp3 hybridized orbitals where the first orbital (Dark Green) is filled with lone pairs. Others bond by 2$\pi$ (Green,Blue) and 1$\sigma$ (Pink)

#### Bond  Energies & Bond length
The  energy of a bond relies on the lenght between the two nuclei, If it is less (The electrons in orbitals are more close) then the bond energy is high:
-	The bond energy decrease down the group as the length is increasing

### Bonds & Bond Properties
There are three types of bonding;
1. Vander Waals Forces
2. Dipole-Dipole Bonding
3. Hydrogen Bonding

#### Vander Waals Forces
Van der Waals forces are driven by induced electrical interactions between two or more atoms or molecules that are very close to each other. Van der Waals interaction is the weakest of all intermolecular attractions between molecules. However, with a lot of Van der Waals forces interacting between two objects, the interaction can be very strong.

These forces occur due to the forming of temporary dipoles, As the electrons are constantly moving. it's possible that at some point  all electrons are on one side and causes a temporary dipole. 
![](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/15615/fluctuate1.GIF?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=112&height=35) 
When approached by another atom, an INDUCED dipole can form like so

![](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/15610/induced1.GIF?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=256&height=106)
This is not even limited to a single atom of course, As long  as they have synchronized dipoles. They will be attracted
![](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/15609/lattice.GIF?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=313&height=97)


#### Dipole - Dipole
Dipole-Dipole interactions result when two dipolar molecules interact with each other through space. When this occurs, the partially negative portion of one of the polar molecules is attracted to the partially positive portion of the second polar molecule. This type of interaction between molecules accounts for many physically and biologically significant phenomena such as the elevated boiling point of water.


#### Hydrogen Bonding
An IMF (Intermolecular Force), that forms special type of dipole-dipole attraction when a hydrogen atom bonded to a strongly electronegative atom exists in the vicinity of another electronegative atom with a lone pair of electrons, IMFs occur between molecules. Other examples include ordinary dipole-dipole interactions and dispersion forces. Hydrogen bonds are are generally stronger than ordinary dipole-dipole and dispersion forces, but weaker than true covalent and ionic bonds.
Boiling points of Group 14:
![[Pasted image 20211114151111.png]]
The increase in boiling point happens because the molecules are getting larger with more electrons, and so [van der Waals](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Atomic_and_Molecular_Properties/Intermolecular_Forces/Specific_Interactions/Van_Der_Waals_Interactions "Physical Chemistry/Quantum Mechanics/Atomic Theory/Intermolecular Forces/Van Der Waals Interactions") dispersion forces become greater. If you repeat this exercise with the compounds of the elements in [groups 15](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Group/Group_15%3A_The_Nitrogen_Family "Group 15: The Nitrogen Family"), [16,](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Group/Group_16%3A_The_Oxygen_Family "Group 16: The Oxygen Family") and [17](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Inorganic_Chemistry/Supplemental_Modules_and_Websites_(Inorganic_Chemistry)/Descriptive_Chemistry/Elements_Organized_by_Group/Group_17%3A_The_Halogens "Group 17: The Halogens") with hydrogen, something odd happens.
![[Pasted image 20211114151145.png]]
As O, F, N have high charge density their BP is unusually high, As we go down the group. The size of the atom increase, DECREASING the charge density and hence there is a sudden drop in BP

Understanding Hydrogen Bonding:
![](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/50661/nh3h2ohf.GIF?revision=1)
-   The hydrogen is attached directly to a highly electronegative atoms, causing the hydrogen to acquire a highly positive charge.
-   Each of the highly electronegative atoms attains a high negative charge and has at least one "active" lone pair. Lone pairs at the 2-level have electrons contained in a relatively small volume of space, resulting in a high negative charge density. Lone pairs at higher levels are more diffuse and, resulting in a lower charge density and lower affinity for positive charge.
### On Boiling Point

When we consider the [boiling](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/States_of_Matter/Phase_Transitions/Boiling "Physical Chemistry/Physical Properties of Matter/Liquids/Boiling") points of molecules, we usually expect molecules with larger molar masses to have higher normal boiling points than molecules with smaller molar masses. This, without taking hydrogen bonds into account, is due to greater dispersion forces (see Interactions Between Nonpolar Molecules). Larger molecules have more space for electron distribution and thus more possibilities for an instantaneous dipole moment. However, when we consider the table below, we see that this is not always the case.
![[Pasted image 20211114152046.png]]

We see that H2O, HF, and NH3 each have higher boiling points than the same compound formed between hydrogen and the next element moving down its respective group, indicating that the former have greater intermolecular forces. This is because H2O, HF, and NH3 all exhibit hydrogen bonding, whereas the others do not. Furthermore, H2OH2O has a smaller molar mass than HF but partakes in more hydrogen bonds per molecule, so its boiling point is higher.

## Factors preventing Hydrogen bonding

### Electronegativity

Hydrogen bonding cannot occur without significant electronegativity differences between hydrogen and the atom it is bonded to. Thus, we see molecules such as PH3, which no not partake in hydrogen bonding. PH3 exhibits a trigonal pyramidal molecular geometry like that of ammonia, but unlike NH3 it cannot hydrogen bond. This is due to the similarity in the electronegativities of phosphorous and hydrogen. Both atoms have an electronegativity of 2.1, and thus, no dipole moment occurs. This prevents the hydrogen bonding from acquiring the partial positive charge needed to hydrogen bond with the lone electron pair in another molecule. (see [Polarizability](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/Atomic_and_Molecular_Properties/Intermolecular_Forces/Specific_Interactions/Polarizability "Physical Chemistry/Quantum Mechanics/Intermolecular Forces/Polarizability"))

![Phosphine.jpg](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/8910/Phosphine.jpg?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=236&height=156)

### Atom Size

The size of donors and acceptors can also effect the ability to hydrogen bond. This can account for the relatively low ability of Cl to form hydrogen bonds. When the radii of two atoms differ greatly or are large, their nuclei cannot achieve close proximity when they interact, resulting in a weak interaction.

![Radii.jpg](https://chem.libretexts.org/@api/deki/files/8911/Radii.jpg?revision=1&size=bestfit&width=215&height=148)

## Hydrogen Bonding in Nature

Hydrogen bonding plays a crucial role in many biological processes and can account for many natural phenomena such as the [Unusual properties of Water](https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry_Textbook_Maps/Supplemental_Modules_(Physical_and_Theoretical_Chemistry)/Physical_Properties_of_Matter/States_of_Matter/Properties_of_Liquids/Unusual_Properties_of_Water "Physical Chemistry/Physical Properties of Matter/Intermolecular Forces/Unusual Properties of Water"). In addition to being present in water, hydrogen bonding is also important in the water transport system of plants, secondary and tertiary protein structure, and DNA base pairing.
