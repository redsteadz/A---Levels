## Alkanes

### **Production**

Hydrogenation of Alkenes
**Conditions** : $\ce{Ni}$ as catalyst 
![[Pasted image 20220402160408.png]]
### **Cracking of Long chain Alkanes**
**Conditions:** $\ce{Al2O3}$
![[Pasted image 20220402161131.png]]
### Combustion Of Alkanes
--- Same as olvl ---

### Free radical Substitution of Alkanes
Not for flourine since It just completely Oxidizes the carbon
![[Pasted image 20220402163103.png]]
Not for Iodine since it's highly unreactive
This is a photochemical Reaction:
![[Pasted image 20220402163215.png]]
All under ultraviolet rays
**Observation** Steamy Fumes, Green yellow Gas disappears
- Deciding which isomer should be made by looking at the ratio of Hydrogen - Carbon bonds

## Mechanisms
- Free radical Substitution (No dipoles, No charges, Only lone pairs)

## Alkenes:

### **Production**
- Elimination of HX from halogenalkane by **ethanolic NaOH** and Heat
	- **Conditions** Ethanolic $\ce{NaOH}$, Heat under reflux?
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402165717.png]]
	- ETHANOL encourages elimination b/w $\ce{NaOH}$ and Carbo stuff

- Dehydration of Alcohol
	- **Conditions** $\ce{Al2O3}$ and heat
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402165923.png]]

- Cracking a longer chain Alkane
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402161131.png]]
- Dehydration of Alcohol
	- **Conditions** $\ce{Al2O3,H3PO4,H2SO4}$ Sulfuric acid discouraged because it is a strong oxidizing agent
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402170923.png]]
	- **COMPLEX -OLS**
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402171057.png]]
	- Which isomers are to be formed is a matter of chance
### Reactions

**Electrophilic Addition**
- Hydrogenation
	- **Conditions** : $\ce{Ni}$ as catalyst 
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402160408.png]]
- Steam(H2O)
	- **Conditions** $\ce{H3PO4}$ heat for more complex Alkenes, Hydrogen prefers more Hydrogen Carbon in the C=C bond
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402170504.png]]
	
- Halogen(NOT UV)
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402171700.png]]
- Hydrogen Halides RTP
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402173344.png]]
- **Oxidation/Reduction**
	- ![[Pasted image 20220402174411.png]]
	Hot $\ce{KMnO4}$ has same breaking shiz reaction. Where CH2 is oxidized to CO2 and H2O



### Alkyl - Positive Inductive
- More Alkyls around carbon, More negatively charged that C=C becomes. More reaction
