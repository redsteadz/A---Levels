## 6 Electrochemistry
6.1 Redox processes: electron transfer and changes in oxidation number (oxidation state)
1. Calculate oxidation numbers of elements in compounds and ions
2. Use changes in oxidation numbers to help balance chemical equations
3. Explain and use the terms redox, oxidation, reduction and disproportionation in terms of electron transfer and changes in oxidation number
4. Explain and use the terms oxidising agent and reducing agent
5. Use a Roman numeral to indicate the magnitude of the oxidation number of an element

### Calculation
In order to calculate the rules need to be followed !

```ad-note
title:**Rule 1** In its pure elemental form, an atom has an oxidation number of zero.

A Pure **Element** is an atom that is not combined with any other elements. <img src="https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/pure_element.png" alt="Oxidation Number of Pure Elements">
- Note that $\ce{S8}$ is still considered a pure element as hey are not combined by any other element
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 2** The oxidation number of an ion is the same as its charge!

An ion is an atom with a charge due to gain or loss of electrons.
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 3** The oxidation number of metals is +1 in G-1 and +2 in G-2

Unless it is in pure elemental form, the oxidation number of a metal is +1 in group 1 and +2 in G-2. It is hydrogen in Group 1, Hydrogen is not a metal, so hydrogen is not included in this rule
```


```ad-note
title:**Rule 4** Hydrogen has two possible oxidation numbers +1 & -1
Hydrogen has an oxidation number of +1 when it is bonded to nonmetals. And a Charge of -1 when it is bonded to metals 

```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 5** Oxygen has three possible Oxidation numbers +2, -2 & -1

In general Oxygen has an oxidation number -2. The only exceptions are peroxides $\ce{R^1 \bond{-}  O  \bond{-} O \bond{-} R^2 }$ - where oxygen has an oxidation number of -1. and in the compound of oxygen difluoride $\ce{OF2}$ where it has an oxidation number of +2
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 6** The Oxidation number of fluorine in any compound is -1

A few examples of flourine - containing compounds are hydrogen fluoride or hydrofuoric acid$\ce{HF}$, sulfur hexafluroride$\ce{SF_6}$, and sodium fluoride $\ce{NaF}$
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 7** For the other halogens (Cl, Br, I) the usual oxidation number is -1 except when they are combined with oxygen or fluorine

In the compound Sodium Chloride, the oxidation number of chlorine is -1 in the compount hydrochlorous acid $\ce{HOF}$ the oxidation number of chlorine is +1 and in the compount perchloric acid$\ce{HClO4}$, the oxidation number of chlorine is +7
```

```ad-note
title:**Rule 8** The sum of the oxidation numbers in a neutral compound is equal to zero.

```

```ad-note
title: **Rule 9** The sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion is equal to the charge of the ion
```

### Balancing Equations:
In order to balance these equations, You need to keep in mind that change in charge on both sides needs to be the same, So if 2 electrons was lost by one substance then 2 electrons NEEDS to be gained by the other for it to be balanced

example:

Step 2:
$\ce{NH3 + O2 -> N02 + H2O}$
$\ce{N^{{-3}} -> N^{{+4}} + 7e^-}$
$\ce{O_2 + 2e^- -> 2O^2-}$

Balance:
$\ce{2N^{{-3}} -> 2N^{{+4}} + 7e^-}$ x2
$\ce{7O_2 + 14e^- -> 7O^2-}$ x7
Now make sure that the number of that element is same in both sides:
$\ce{2NH3 + 3.5O2 -> 2NO2 + 3H2O}$

### Terms:
Redox: Is a reaction where electron is lost and gained, Or it is when the oxidation number changes

Oxidation: Is when Electrons are lost, Oxygen is gained, Hydrogen is lost Oxidation number is increased

Reduction: Is when Electrons are gained, Oxygen is lost, Hydrogen is gained, Oxydation number is reduced

Disproportionation: A reaction in which a substance is simultaneously oxidized and reduced giving two different products

### Oxidation Numbers and Systematic Formulas:

This is referring to state the exact number of oxidation number of the element within the compound so;
$\ce{SO3}$
$\ce{S^{{6+}}O^{{2-}}}_3$ would be written as - Sulfur (VI) Oxide instead of Sulfur Tri-Oxide
