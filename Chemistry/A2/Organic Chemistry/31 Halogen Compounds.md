# 31.1 Halogen compounds
1. recall the reactions by which halogenoarenes can be produced: substitution of an arene with Cl₂ or Br₂ in the presence of a catalyst, A/CL or A/Br, to form a halogenoarene, exemplified by benzene to form chlorobenzene and methylbenzene to form 2-chloromethylbenzene and 4-chloromethylbenzene
2. explain the difference in reactivity between a halogenoalkane and a halogenoarene as exemplified by chloroethane and chlorobenzene
___

___
-   Chlorine gas is bubbled into benzene at room temperature and in the presence of an anhydrous AlCl3 catalyst to form **chlorobenzene**
-   The AlCl3 catalyst is also called a **halogen carrier** and is required to generate the **electrophile** (Cl+)
-   This electrophile **attacks** the electron-rich benzene ring in the **first stage** of the reaction which **disrupts** the delocalised π system in the ring
-   To restore the **aromatic stabilization,** a hydrogen atom is removed in the **second stage** of the electrophilic substitution reaction to form chlorobenzene
-   When this happens, the delocalised π system of the ring is **restored**
-   The same reaction occurs with benzene and bromine in the presence of an AlBr3 catalyst to form **bromobenzene**

## Reactivity
-   **Halogenoarenes** are very **unreactive** compared to **halogenoalkanes**
-   The difference in reactivity between the two compounds is because of the carbon-halogen bond strengths
#### Halogenoalkanes
-   The halogenoalkane **chloroethane** can take part in **nucleophilic substitution** reactions
-   A **nucleophile**, such as a hydroxide (OH-) ion, will attack the **slightly positive carbon** atom
-   A covalent bond is formed between that carbon atom and the nucleophile which causes the carbon-halogen bond to break
-   Overall, the halogen is replaced by the nucleophile

#### Halogenoarenes

-   Halogenoarenes, such as chlorobenzene, **do not** readily undergo **nucleophilic substitution** reactions
    
    -   Only under extremely **harsh** conditions, such as temperatures of 200 oC and a pressure of 200 atmospheres, will the chlorine in chlorobenzene get replaced by a nucleophile such as a hydroxide (OH-) ion
    
-   This is because the carbon-chlorine bond is **very strong** and cannot be easily broken
    -   One of the lone pairs of electrons on the chlorine will **interact** with the π system of the ring
    -   This causes the carbon-chlorine bond to have a **partial double-bond character,** which **strengthens** the bond

![[Chemistry/A2/Organic Chemistry/attatchments/Pasted image 20220823153711.png]]
-   The **unreactivity** of halogenoarenes can therefore be explained by the **delocalisation** of a lone pair on the halogen over the benzene
-   This causes additional **stabilisation** of the system and **strengthens** the carbon-halogen bond, which affects the reactions that halogenoarenes will undergo
-   It gets **harder** to break the carbon-halogen bond in halogenoarenes, which decreases reactivity
