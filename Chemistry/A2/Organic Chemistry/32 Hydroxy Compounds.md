# 32 Hydroxy compounds
## 32.1 Alcohols
1. describe the reaction with acyl chlorides to form esters using ethyl ethanoate

## 32.2 Phenol
1. recall the reactions (reagents and conditions) by which phenol can be produced:
(a) reaction of phenylamine with HNO₂ or NaNO₂ and dilute acid below 10 °C to produce the diazoni
salt; further warming of the diazonium salt with H₂O to give phenol
2. recall the chemistry of phenol, as exemplified by the following reactions:
(a) with bases, for example NaOH(aq) to produce sodium phenoxide
(b) with Na(s) to produce sodium phenoxide and H₂(g)
(c) in NaOH(aq) with diazonium salts, to give azo compounds
(d) nitration of the aromatic ring with dilute HNO3(aq) at room temperature to give a mixture of
2-nitrophenol and 4-nitrophenol
(e) bromination of the aromatic ring with Br₂(aq) to form 2,4,6-tribromophenol
3. explain the acidity of phenol
4. describe and explain the relative acidities of water, phenol and ethanol
5. explain why the reagents and conditions for the nitration and bromination of phenol are different fron for benzene
6. recall that the hydroxyl group of a phenol directs to the 2-, 4- and 6-positions
7. apply knowledge of the reactions of phenol to those of other phenolic compounds, e.g. naphthol

___
## Alcohols
- Formation of Acids by
	- **Acyl Chloride + Alcohol**
		- Gives better Yield because
			- Acyl Chloride are more reactive
			- The Reaction goes to completion
			- Vigorous reaction
		- ![[Chemistry/A2/Organic Chemistry/attatchments/Hydroxy Compounds AcylChloride+Alcohol.excalidraw]]
	- **Acyl Chloride + Phenols**
		- **Base and Heat**
		- Base to Deprotonate(Taking a proton) the phenol, making it a better Nucleophile (Pehnoxide Ion)
		- ![[Chemistry/A2/Organic Chemistry/attatchments/Hydroxy Compounds Acyl Chloride + Phenol.excalidraw]]
