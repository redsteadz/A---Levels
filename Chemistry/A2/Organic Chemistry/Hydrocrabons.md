## 30.1 Arenes
1. describe the chemistry of arenes as exemplified by the following reactions of benzene and methylbenzene:
(a) substitution reactions with C2₂ and with Br₂ in the presence of a catalyst, AICI, or A/Br3, to form halogenoarenes (aryl halides)
(b) nitration with a mixture of concentrated HNO3 and concentrated H₂SO at a temperature between 25 °C and 60°C
(c) Friedel-Crafts alkylation by CH₂Cl and A/C1, and heat
(d) Friedel-Crafts acylation by CH3COCI and AICI, and heat
(e) complete oxidation of the side-chain using hot alkaline KMnO, and then dilute acid to give a benzoic
acid
(f) hydrogenation of the benzene ring using H₂ and Pt/Ni catalyst and heat to form a cyclohexane ring
2. describe the mechanism of electrophilic substitution in arenes:
(a) as exemplified by the formation of nitrobenzene and bromobenzene
(b) with regards to the effect of delocalisation (aromatic stabilisation) of electrons in arenes to explain the
predomination of substitution over addition
3. predict whether halogenation will occur in the side-chain or in the aromatic ring in arenes depending on reaction conditions
4. describe that in the electrophilic substitution of arenes, different substituents direct to different ring positions (limited to the directing effects of -NH₂, -OH, -R, -NO₂, -COOH and -COR)
