- **Naming in Group C**:
  1. Find the longest continuous carbon chain. Determine the root name for this parent chain In cyclic compounds, the ring is usually considered the parent chain, unless it is attached to a longer chain of carbons; indicate a ring with the prefix “cyclo” before the root name. (When there are two longest chains of equal length, use the chain with the greater number of substituents.)
  2. Number the chain in the direction such that the position number of the first substituent is the smaller number. If the first substituents from either end have the same number, then number so that the second substituent has the smaller number, etc.
  3. Determine the name and position number of each substituent. (A substituent on a nitrogen is designated with an “N” instead of a number; see Section III.D.1. below.)
  4. Indicate the number of identical groups by the prefixes di, tri, tetra, etc.
  5. Place the position numbers and names of the substituent groups, in alphabetical order, before the root name. In alphabetizing, ignore prefixes like sec-, tert-, di, tri, etc., but include iso and cyclo. Always include a position number for each substituent, regardless of redundancies.
