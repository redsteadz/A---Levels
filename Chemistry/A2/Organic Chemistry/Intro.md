___
## 29.1 Formulae, functional groups and the naming of organic compounds
1. understand that the compounds in the table on page 42 contain a functional group which dictates their physical and chemical properties
2. interpret and use the general, structural, displayed and skeletal formulae of the classes of compound stated in the table on page 42
3. understand and use systematic nomenclature of simple aliphatic organic molecules (including cyclic compounds containing a single ring of up to six carbon atoms) with functional groups detailed in the table on page 42, up to six carbon atoms (six plus six for esters and amides, straight chains only for esters and nitriles)
4. understand and use systematic nomenclature of simple aromatic molecules with one benzene ring and one or more simple substituents, for example 3-nitrobenzoic acid or 2,4,6-tribromophenol
## 29.2 Characteristic organic reactions
1. understand and use the following terminology associated with types of organic mechanisms:
(a) electrophilic substitution
(b) addition-elimination
## 29.3 Shapes of aromatic organic molecules; o and it bonds
1. describe and explain the shape of benzene and other aromatic molecules, including spÂ² hybridisation, in terms of a bonds and a delocalised system
